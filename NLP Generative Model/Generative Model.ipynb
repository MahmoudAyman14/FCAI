            "\n",
            "Deep learning is the subset of machine learning methods based on neural networks with representation learning. The adjective \"deep\" refers to the use of multiple layers in the network. Methods used can be either supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.\n",
            "Deep-learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks, recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks and transformers have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, climate science, material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance.\n",
            "Early forms of neural networks were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems, in particular the human brain. However, current neural networks do not intend to model the brain function of organisms, and are generally seen as low quality models for that purpose.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "== Overview ==\n",
            "Most modern deep learning models are based on multi-layered neural networks such as convolutional neural networks and transformers, although they can also include propositional formulas or latent variables organized layer-wise in deep generative models such as the nodes in deep belief networks and deep Boltzmann machines.\n",
            "Fundamentally, deep learning refers to a class of machine learning algorithms in which a hierarchy of layers is used to transform input data into a slightly more abstract and composite representation. For example, in an image recognition model, the raw input may be an image (represented as a tensor of pixels). The first representational layer may attempt to identify basic shapes such as lines and circles, the second layer may compose and encode arrangements of edges, the third layer may encode a nose and eyes, and the fourth layer may recognize that the image contains a face.\n",
            "Importantly, a deep learning process can learn which features to optimally place in which level on its own. Prior to deep learning, machine learning techniques often involved hand-crafted feature engineering to transform the data into a more suitable representation for a classification algorithm to operate upon. In the deep learning approach, features are not hand-crafted and the model discovers useful feature representations from the data automatically. This does not eliminate the need for hand-tuning; for example, varying numbers of layers and layer sizes can provide different degrees of abstraction.\n",
            "The word \"deep\" in \"deep learning\" refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed. More precisely, deep learning systems have a substantial credit assignment path (CAP) depth. The CAP is the chain of transformations from input to output. CAPs describe potentially causal connections between input and output. For a feedforward neural network, the depth of the CAPs is that of the network and is the number of hidden layers plus one (as the output layer is also parameterized). For recurrent neural networks, in which a signal may propagate through a layer more than once, the CAP depth is potentially unlimited. No universally agreed-upon threshold of depth divides shallow learning from deep learning, but most researchers agree that deep learning involves CAP depth higher than 2. CAP of depth 2 has been shown to be a universal approximator in the sense that it can emulate any function. Beyond that, more layers do not add to the function approximator ability of the network. Deep models (CAP > 2) are able to extract better features than shallow models and hence, extra layers help in learning the features effectively.\n",
            "Deep learning architectures can be constructed with a greedy layer-by-layer method. Deep learning helps to disentangle these abstractions and pick out which features improve performance.\n",
            "Deep learning algorithms can be applied to unsupervised learning tasks. This is an important benefit because unlabeled data are more abundant than the labeled data. Examples of deep structures that can be trained in an unsupervised manner are deep belief networks.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "== Interpretations ==\n",
            "Deep neural networks are generally interpreted in terms of the universal approximation theorem or probabilistic inference.\n",
            "The classic universal approximation theorem concerns the capacity of feedforward neural networks with a single hidden layer of finite size to approximate continuous functions. In 1989, the first proof was published by George Cybenko for sigmoid activation functions and was generalised to feed-forward multi-layer architectures in 1991 by Kurt Hornik. Recent work also showed that universal approximation also holds for non-bounded activation functions such as Kunihiko Fukushima's rectified linear unit.\n",
            "The universal approximation theorem for deep neural networks concerns the capacity of networks with bounded width but the depth is allowed to grow. Lu et al. proved that if the width of a deep neural network with ReLU activation is strictly larger than the input dimension, then the network can approximate any Lebesgue integrable function; if the width is smaller or equal to the input dimension, then a deep neural network is not a universal approximator.\n",
            "The probabilistic interpretation derives from the field of machine learning. It features inference, as well as the optimization concepts of training and testing, related to fitting and generalization, respectively. More specifically, the probabilistic interpretation considers the activation nonlinearity as a cumulative distribution function. The probabilistic interpretation led to the introduction of dropout as regularizer in neural networks. The probabilistic interpretation was introduced by researchers including Hopfield, Widrow and Narendra and popularized in surveys such as the one by Bishop.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "== History ==\n",
            "There were two types of artificial neural network (ANN): feedforward neural networks (FNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). RNNs have cycles in their connectivity structure, FNNs don't. In the 1920s, Wilhelm Lenz and Ernst Ising created and analyzed the Ising model which is essentially a non-learning RNN architecture consisting of neuron-like threshold elements. In 1972, Shun'ichi Amari made this architecture adaptive. His learning RNN was popularised by John Hopfield in 1982.\n",
            "Charles Tappert writes that Frank Rosenblatt developed and explored all of the basic ingredients of the deep learning systems of today, referring to Rosenblatt's 1962 book which introduced multilayer perceptron (MLP) with 3 layers: an input layer, a hidden layer with randomized weights that did not learn, and an output layer. It also introduced variants, including a version with four-layer perceptrons where the last two layers have learned weights (and thus a proper multilayer perceptron).: section 16  In addition, term deep learning was proposed in 1986 by Rina Dechter although the history of its appearance is apparently more complicated.\n",
            "The first general, working learning algorithm for supervised, deep, feedforward, multilayer perceptrons was published by Alexey Ivakhnenko and Lapa in 1967. A 1971 paper described a deep network with eight layers trained by the group method of data handling.\n",
            "The first deep learning multilayer perceptron trained by stochastic gradient descent was published in 1967 by Shun'ichi Amari. In computer experiments conducted by Amari's student Saito, a five layer MLP with two modifiable layers learned  internal representations to classify non-linearily separable pattern classes. In 1987 Matthew Brand reported that wide 12-layer nonlinear perceptrons could be fully end-to-end trained to reproduce logic functions of nontrivial circuit depth via gradient descent on small batches of random input/output samples, but concluded that training time on contemporary hardware (sub-megaflop computers) made the technique impractical, and proposed using fixed random early layers as an input hash for a single modifiable layer.  Instead, subsequent developments in hardware and hyperparameter tunings have made end-to-end stochastic gradient descent the currently dominant training technique.\n",
            "In 1970, Seppo Linnainmaa published the reverse mode of automatic differentiation of discrete connected networks of nested differentiable functions. This became known as backpropagation. It is an efficient application of the chain rule derived by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1673 to networks of differentiable nodes. \n",
            "The terminology \"back-propagating errors\" was actually introduced in 1962 by Rosenblatt, but he did not know how to implement this, although Henry J. Kelley had a continuous precursor of backpropagation already in 1960 in the context of control theory. In 1982, Paul Werbos applied backpropagation to MLPs in the way that has become standard. In 1985, David E. Rumelhart et al. published an experimental analysis of the technique.\n",
            "Deep learning architectures for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with convolutional layers and downsampling layers began with the Neocognitron introduced by Kunihiko Fukushima in 1980. In 1969, he also introduced the ReLU (rectified linear unit) activation function. The rectifier has become the most popular activation function for CNNs and deep learning in general. CNNs have become an essential tool for computer vision.\n",
            "The term Deep Learning was introduced to the machine learning community by Rina Dechter in 1986, and to artificial neural networks by Igor Aizenberg and colleagues in 2000, in the context of Boolean threshold neurons.\n",
            "In 1988, Wei Zhang et al. applied the backpropagation algorithm \n",
            "to a convolutional neural network (a simplified Neocognitron with convolutional interconnections between the image feature layers and the last fully connected layer) for alphabet recognition. They also proposed an implementation of the CNN with an optical computing system. \n",
            "In 1989, Yann LeCun et al. applied backpropagation to a CNN with the purpose of recognizing handwritten ZIP codes on mail. While the algorithm worked, training required 3 days. Subsequently, Wei Zhang, et al. modified their model by removing the last fully connected layer and applied it for medical image object segmentation in 1991 and breast cancer detection in mammograms in 1994. LeNet-5 (1998), a 7-level CNN by Yann LeCun et al., that classifies digits, was applied by several banks to recognize hand-written numbers on checks  digitized in 32x32 pixel images.\n",
            "In the 1980s, backpropagation did not work well for deep learning with long credit assignment paths. To overcome this problem, Jürgen Schmidhuber (1992) proposed a hierarchy of RNNs pre-trained one level at a time by self-supervised learning. It uses predictive coding  to learn internal representations at multiple self-organizing time scales. This can substantially facilitate downstream deep learning. The RNN hierarchy can be collapsed into a single RNN, by distilling a higher level chunker network into a lower level automatizer network. In 1993, a chunker solved a deep learning task whose depth exceeded 1000.\n",
            "In 1992, Jürgen Schmidhuber also published an alternative to RNNs which is now called a linear Transformer or a  Transformer with linearized self-attention (save for a normalization operator). It learns internal spotlights of attention: a slow feedforward neural network learns by gradient descent to control the fast weights of another neural network through outer products of self-generated activation patterns FROM and TO (which are now called key and value for self-attention). This fast weight attention mapping is applied to a query pattern.\n",
            "The modern Transformer was introduced by Ashish Vaswani et al. in their 2017 paper \"Attention Is All You Need\". \n",
            "It combines this with a softmax operator and a projection matrix.\n",
            "Transformers have increasingly become the model of choice for natural language processing. Many modern large language models such as ChatGPT, GPT-4, and BERT use it. Transformers are also increasingly being used in computer vision.\n",
            "In 1991, Jürgen Schmidhuber also published adversarial neural networks that contest with each other in the form of a zero-sum game, where one network's gain is the other network's loss. The first network is a generative model that models a probability distribution over output patterns. The second network learns by gradient descent to predict the reactions of the environment to these patterns. This was called \"artificial curiosity\". In 2014, this principle was used in a generative adversarial network (GAN) by Ian Goodfellow et al. Here the environmental reaction is 1 or 0 depending on whether the first network's output is in a given set. This can be used to create realistic deepfakes. Excellent image quality is achieved by Nvidia's StyleGAN (2018) based on the Progressive GAN by Tero Karras et al. Here the GAN generator is grown from small to large scale in a pyramidal fashion.\n",
            "Sepp Hochreiter's diploma thesis (1991) was called \"one of the most important documents in the history of machine learning\" by his supervisor Schmidhuber. It not only tested the neural history compressor, but also identified and analyzed the vanishing gradient problem. Hochreiter proposed recurrent residual connections to solve this problem. This led to the deep learning method called long short-term memory (LSTM), published in 1997. LSTM recurrent neural networks can learn \"very deep learning\" tasks with long credit assignment paths that require memories of events that happened thousands of discrete time steps before. The \"vanilla LSTM\" with forget gate was introduced in 1999 by Felix Gers, Schmidhuber and Fred Cummins. LSTM has become the  most cited neural network of the 20th century.\n",
            "In 2015, Rupesh Kumar Srivastava, Klaus Greff, and Schmidhuber used LSTM principles to create the Highway network, a feedforward neural network with hundreds of layers, much deeper than previous networks. 7 months later, Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang;  Shaoqing Ren, and Jian Sun won the ImageNet 2015 competition with an open-gated or gateless Highway network variant called Residual neural network. This has become the most cited neural network of the 21st century.\n",
            "In 1994, André de Carvalho, together with Mike Fairhurst and David Bisset, published experimental results of a multi-layer boolean neural network, also known as a weightless neural network, composed of a 3-layers self-organising feature extraction neural network module (SOFT) followed by a multi-layer classification neural network module (GSN), which were independently trained. Each layer in the feature extraction module extracted features with growing complexity regarding the previous layer.\n",
            "In 1995, Brendan Frey demonstrated that it was possible to train (over two days) a network containing six fully connected layers and several hundred hidden units using the wake-sleep algorithm, co-developed with Peter Dayan and Hinton.\n",
            "Since 1997, Sven Behnke extended the feed-forward hierarchical convolutional approach in the Neural Abstraction Pyramid by lateral and backward connections in order to flexibly incorporate context into decisions and iteratively resolve local ambiguities.\n",
            "Simpler models that use task-specific handcrafted features such as Gabor filters and support vector machines (SVMs) were a popular choice in the 1990s and 2000s, because of artificial neural networks' computational cost and a lack of understanding of how the brain wires its biological networks.\n",
            "Both shallow and deep learning (e.g., recurrent nets) of ANNs for speech recognition have been explored for many years. These methods never outperformed non-uniform internal-handcrafting Gaussian mixture model/Hidden Markov model (GMM-HMM) technology based on generative models of speech trained discriminatively. Key difficulties have been analyzed, including gradient diminishing and weak temporal correlation structure in neural predictive models. Additional difficulties were the lack of training data and limited computing power. Most speech recognition researchers moved away from neural nets to pursue generative modeling. An exception was at SRI International in the late 1990s. Funded by the US government's NSA and DARPA, SRI studied deep neural networks (DNNs) in speech and speaker recognition. The speaker recognition team led by Larry Heck reported significant success with deep neural networks in speech processing in the 1998 National Institute of Standards and Technology Speaker Recognition evaluation. The SRI deep neural network was then deployed in the Nuance Verifier, representing the first major industrial application of deep learning. The principle of elevating \"raw\" features over hand-crafted optimization was first explored successfully in the architecture of deep autoencoder on the \"raw\" spectrogram or linear filter-bank features in the late 1990s, showing its superiority over the Mel-Cepstral features that contain stages of fixed transformation from spectrograms. The raw features of speech, waveforms, later produced excellent larger-scale results.\n",
            "Speech recognition was taken over by LSTM. In 2003, LSTM started to become competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks. In 2006, Alex Graves, Santiago Fernández, Faustino Gomez, and Schmidhuber combined it with connectionist temporal classification (CTC) in stacks of LSTM RNNs. In 2015, Google's speech recognition reportedly experienced a dramatic performance jump of 49% through CTC-trained LSTM, which they made available through Google Voice Search.\n",
            "The impact of deep learning in industry began in the early 2000s, when CNNs already processed an estimated 10% to 20% of all the checks written in the US, according to Yann LeCun. Industrial applications of deep learning to large-scale speech recognition started around 2010.\n",
            "In 2006, publications by Geoff Hinton, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Osindero and Teh showed how a many-layered feedforward neural network could be effectively pre-trained one layer at a time, treating each layer in turn as an unsupervised restricted Boltzmann machine, then fine-tuning it using supervised backpropagation. The papers referred to learning for deep belief nets.\n",
            "The 2009 NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning for Speech Recognition was motivated by the limitations of deep generative models of speech, and the possibility that given more capable hardware and large-scale data sets that deep neural nets might become practical. It was believed that pre-training DNNs using generative models of deep belief nets (DBN) would overcome the main difficulties of neural nets. However, it was discovered that replacing pre-training with large amounts of training data for straightforward backpropagation when using DNNs with large, context-dependent output layers produced error rates dramatically lower than then-state-of-the-art Gaussian mixture model (GMM)/Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and also than more-advanced generative model-based systems. The nature of the recognition errors produced by the two types of systems was characteristically different, offering technical insights into how to integrate deep learning into the existing highly efficient, run-time speech decoding system deployed by all major speech recognition systems. Analysis around 2009–2010, contrasting the GMM (and other generative speech models) vs. DNN models, stimulated early industrial investment in deep learning for speech recognition.  That analysis was done with comparable performance (less than 1.5% in error rate) between discriminative DNNs and generative models.\n",
            "In 2010, researchers extended deep learning from TIMIT to large vocabulary speech recognition, by adopting large output layers of the DNN based on context-dependent HMM states constructed by decision trees.\n",
            "Deep learning is part of state-of-the-art systems in various disciplines, particularly computer vision and automatic speech recognition (ASR). Results on commonly used evaluation sets such as TIMIT (ASR) and MNIST (image classification), as well as a range of large-vocabulary speech recognition tasks have steadily improved. Convolutional neural networks were superseded for ASR by CTC for LSTM. but are more successful in computer vision.\n",
            "Advances in hardware have driven renewed interest in deep learning. In 2009, Nvidia was involved in what was called the \"big bang\" of deep learning, \"as deep-learning neural networks were trained with Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs)\". That year, Andrew Ng determined that GPUs could increase the speed of deep-learning systems by about 100 times. In particular, GPUs are well-suited for the matrix/vector computations involved in machine learning. GPUs speed up training algorithms by orders of magnitude, reducing running times from weeks to days. Further, specialized hardware and algorithm optimizations can be used for efficient processing of deep learning models.\n",

            "In the late 2000s, deep learning started to outperform other methods in machine learning competitions.\n",
            "In 2009, a long short-term memory trained by connectionist temporal classification (Alex Graves, Santiago Fernández, Faustino Gomez, and Jürgen Schmidhuber, 2006) was the first RNN to win pattern recognition contests, winning three competitions in connected handwriting recognition. Google later used CTC-trained LSTM for speech recognition on the smartphone.\n",
            "Significant impacts in image or object recognition were felt from 2011 to 2012. Although CNNs trained by backpropagation had been around for decades, and GPU implementations of NNs for years, including CNNs, faster implementations of CNNs on GPUs were needed to progress on computer vision. In 2011, the DanNet by Dan Ciresan, Ueli Meier, Jonathan Masci, Luca Maria Gambardella, and Jürgen Schmidhuber achieved for the first time superhuman performance in a visual pattern recognition contest, outperforming traditional methods by a factor of 3. Also in 2011, DanNet won the ICDAR Chinese handwriting contest, and in May 2012, it won the ISBI image segmentation contest. Until 2011, CNNs did not play a major role at computer vision conferences, but in June 2012, a paper by Ciresan et al. at the leading conference CVPR showed how max-pooling CNNs on GPU can dramatically improve many vision benchmark records.  In September 2012, DanNet also won the ICPR contest on analysis of large medical images for cancer detection, and in the following year also the MICCAI Grand Challenge on the same topic. In October 2012, the similar AlexNet by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton won the large-scale ImageNet competition by a significant margin over shallow machine learning methods. \n",

            "won the ImageNet 2014 competition, following a similar trend in large-scale speech recognition.\n",

            "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) or connectionist systems are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems learn (progressively improve their ability) to do tasks by considering examples, generally without task-specific programming. For example, in image recognition, they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as \"cat\" or \"no cat\" and using the analytic results to identify cats in other images. They have found most use in applications difficult to express with a traditional computer algorithm using rule-based programming.\n",
            "An ANN is based on a collection of connected units called artificial neurons, (analogous to biological neurons in a biological brain). Each connection (synapse) between neurons can transmit a signal to another neuron. The receiving (postsynaptic) neuron can process the signal(s) and then signal downstream neurons connected to it. Neurons may have state, generally represented by real numbers, typically between 0 and 1. Neurons and synapses may also have a weight that varies as learning proceeds, which can increase or decrease the strength of the signal that it sends downstream.\n",

The weights and inputs are multiplied and return an output between 0 and 1. If the network did not accurately recognize a particular pattern, an algorithm would adjust the weights. That way the algorithm can make certain parameters more influential, until it determines the correct mathematical manipulation to fully process the data.\n",

These developmental theories were instantiated in computational models, making them predecessors of deep learning systems. These developmental models share the property that various proposed learning dynamics in the brain (e.g., a wave of nerve growth factor) support the self-organization somewhat analogous to the neural networks utilized in deep learning models. Like the neocortex, neural networks employ a hierarchy of layered filters in which each layer considers information from a prior layer (or the operating environment), and then passes its output (and possibly the original input), to other layers. This process yields a self-organizing stack of transducers, well-tuned to their operating environment. A 1995 description stated, \"...the infant's brain seems to organize itself under the influence of waves of so-called trophic-factors ... different regions of the brain become connected sequentially, with one layer of tissue maturing before another and so on until the whole brain is mature\".\n",

Learning a grammar (visual or linguistic) from training data would be equivalent to restricting the system to commonsense reasoning that operates on concepts in terms of grammatical production rules and is a basic goal of both human language acquisition and artificial intelligence (AI).\n",

            "As deep learning moves from the lab into the world, research and experience show that artificial neural networks are vulnerable to hacks and deception. By identifying patterns that these systems use to function, attackers can modify inputs to ANNs in such a way that the ANN finds a match that human observers would not recognize. For example, an attacker can make subtle changes to an image such that the ANN finds a match even though the image looks to a human nothing like the search target. Such manipulation is termed an \"adversarial attack\".\n",
            "In 2016 researchers used one ANN to doctor images in trial and error fashion, identify another's focal points, and thereby generate images that deceived it. The modified images looked no different to human eyes. Another group showed that printouts of doctored images then photographed successfully tricked an image classification system. One defense is reverse image search, in which a possible fake image is submitted to a site such as TinEye that can then find other instances of it. A refinement is to search using only parts of the image, to identify images from which that piece may have been taken.\n",
            "Another group showed that certain psychedelic spectacles could fool a facial recognition system into thinking ordinary people were celebrities, potentially allowing one person to impersonate another. In 2017 researchers added stickers to stop signs and caused an ANN to misclassify them.\n",
            "ANNs can however be further trained to detect attempts at deception, potentially leading attackers and defenders into an arms race similar to the kind that already defines the malware defense industry. ANNs have been trained to defeat ANN-based anti-malware software by repeatedly attacking a defense with malware that was continually altered by a genetic algorithm until it tricked the anti-malware while retaining its ability to damage the target.\n",
            "In 2016, another group demonstrated that certain sounds could make the Google Now voice command system open a particular web address, and hypothesized that this could \"serve as a stepping stone for further attacks (e.g., opening a web page hosting drive-by malware)\".\n",

            "Most Deep Learning systems rely on training and verification data that is generated and/or annotated by humans. It has been argued in media philosophy that not only low-paid clickwork (e.g. on Amazon Mechanical Turk) is regularly deployed for this purpose, but also implicit forms of human microwork that are often not recognized as such. The philosopher Rainer Mühlhoff distinguishes five types of \"machinic capture\" of human microwork to generate training data: (1) gamification (the embedding of annotation or computation tasks in the flow of a game), (2) \"trapping and tracking\" (e.g. CAPTCHAs for image recognition or click-tracking on Google search results pages), (3) exploitation of social motivations (e.g. tagging faces on Facebook to obtain labeled facial images), (4) information mining (e.g. by leveraging quantified-self devices such as activity trackers) and (5) clickwork.\n",
            "Mühlhoff argues that in most commercial end-user applications of Deep Learning such as Facebook's face recognition system, the need for training data does not stop once an ANN is trained. Rather, there is a continued demand for human-generated verification data to constantly calibrate and update the ANN. For this purpose, Facebook introduced the feature that once a user is automatically recognized in an image, they receive a notification. They can choose whether or not they like to be publicly labeled on the image, or tell Facebook that it is not them in the picture. This user interface is a mechanism to generate \"a constant stream of verification data\" to further train the network in real-time. As Mühlhoff argues, the involvement of human users to generate training and verification data is so typical for most commercial end-user applications of Deep Learning that such systems may be referred to as \"human-aided artificial intelligence\".\n",

            "\n",
            "Artificial intelligence in healthcare is a term used to describe the use of machine-learning algorithms and software, or artificial intelligence (AI), to copy human cognition in the analysis, presentation, and understanding of complex medical and health care data, or to exceed human capabilities by providing new ways to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease. Specifically, AI is the ability of computer algorithms to arrive at approximate conclusions based solely on input data.\n",
            "The primary aim of health-related AI applications is to analyze relationships between clinical data and patient outcomes. AI programs are applied to practices such as diagnostics, treatment protocol development, drug development, personalized medicine, and patient monitoring and care. What differentiates AI technology from traditional technologies in healthcare is the ability to gather larger and more diverse data, process it, and produce a well-defined output to the end-user. AI does this through machine learning algorithms and deep learning. Because radiographs are the most common imaging tests conducted in most radiology departments, the potential for AI to help with triage and interpretation of traditional radiographs (X-ray pictures) is particularly noteworthy. These processes can recognize patterns in behavior and create their own logic. To gain useful insights and predictions, machine learning models must be trained using extensive amounts of input data. AI algorithms behave differently from humans in two ways: (1) algorithms are literal: once a goal is set, the algorithm learns exclusively from the input data and can only understand what it has been programmed to do, (2) and some deep learning algorithms are black boxes; algorithms can predict with extreme precision, but offer little to no comprehensible explanation to the logic behind its decisions aside from the data and type of algorithm used.\n",
            "As widespread use of AI in healthcare is relatively new, research is ongoing into its application in various fields of medicine and industry. Additionally, greater consideration is being given to the unprecedented ethical concerns related to its practice such as data privacy, automation of jobs, and representation biases. Furthermore, new technologies brought about by AI in healthcare are often resisted by healthcare leaders, leading to slow and erratic adoption.\n",

            "Research in the 1960s and 1970s produced the first problem-solving program, or expert system, known as Dendral. While it was designed for applications in organic chemistry, it provided the basis for a subsequent system MYCIN, considered one of the most significant early uses of artificial intelligence in medicine. MYCIN and other systems such as INTERNIST-1 and CASNET did not achieve routine use by practitioners, however.\n",
            "The 1980s and 1990s brought the proliferation of the microcomputer and new levels of network connectivity. During this time, there was a recognition by researchers and developers that AI systems in healthcare must be designed to accommodate the absence of perfect data and build on the expertise of physicians. Approaches involving fuzzy set theory, Bayesian networks, and artificial neural networks, have been applied to intelligent computing systems in healthcare.\n",
            "Medical and technological advancements occurring over this half-century period that have enabled the growth of healthcare-related applications of AI to include: \n",
            "\n",
            "Improvements in computing power resulting in faster data collection and data processing\n",

            "AI algorithms can also be used to analyze large amounts of data through electronic health records for disease prevention and diagnosis. Medical institutions such as The Mayo Clinic, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and the British National Health Service, have developed AI algorithms for their departments. Large technology companies such as IBM and Google, have also developed AI algorithms for healthcare. Additionally, hospitals are looking to AI software to support operational initiatives that increase cost saving, improve patient satisfaction, and satisfy their staffing and workforce needs. Currently, the United States government is investing billions of dollars to progress the development of AI in healthcare. Companies are developing technologies that help healthcare managers improve business operations through increasing utilization, decreasing patient boarding, reducing length of stay and optimizing staffing levels.\n",

Wearables, smartphones, and internet-based technologies have also shown the ability to monitor patients' cardiac data points, expanding the amount of data and the various settings AI models can use and potentially enabling earlier detection of cardiac events occurring outside of the hospital. Another growing area of research is the utility of AI in classifying heart sounds and diagnosing valvular disease. Challenges of AI in cardiovascular medicine have included the limited data available to train machine learning models, such as limited data on social determinants of health as they pertain to cardiovascular disease.\n",
            "A key limitation in early studies evaluating AI were omissions of data comparing algorithmic performance to humans. Examples of studies which assess AI performance relative to physicians includes how AI is noninferior to humans in interpretation of cardiac echocardiograms and that AI can diagnose heart attack better than human physicians in the emergency setting, reducing both low-value testing and missed diagnoses.\n",

For each modality, deep learning showed great progress. Han et al. showed keratinocytic skin cancer detection from face photographs. Esteva et al. demonstrated dermatologist-level classification of skin cancer from lesion images. Noyan et al. demonstrated a convolutional neural network that achieved 94% accuracy at identifying skin cells from microscopic Tzanck smear images.

While neural networks have been developed to rapidly and accurately detect a host response to COVID-19 from mass spectrometry samples, a scoping review of the literature found few examples of AI being used directly in clinical practice during the COVID-19 pandemic itself. Other applications include support-vector machines identifying antimicrobial resistance, machine learning analysis of blood smears to detect malaria, and improved point-of-care testing of Lyme disease based on antigen detection.

Researchers have conducted a study using a machine-learning algorithm to show that standard radiographic measures of severity overlook objective but undiagnosed features that disproportionately affect diagnosis and management of underserved populations with knee pain.

Researchers have developed models that rely on convolutional neural networks with the aim of improving early diagnostic accuracy. Generative adversarial networks are a form of deep learning that have also performed well in diagnosing AD. There have also been efforts to develop machine learning models into forecasting tools that can predict the prognosis of patients with AD. Forecasting patient outcomes through generative models has been proposed by researchers as a means of synthesizing training and validation sets.

Methods of digital pathology allows microscopy slides to be scanned and digitally analyzed. AI-assisted pathology tools have been developed to assist with the diagnosis of a number of diseases, including breast cancer, hepatitis B, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer. AI has also been used to predict genetic mutations and prognosticate disease outcomes. AI is well-suited for use in low-complexity pathological analysis of large-scale screening samples, such as colorectal or breast cancer screening, thus lessening the burden on pathologists and allowing for faster turnaround of sample analysis. Several deep learning and artificial neural network models have shown accuracy similar to that of human pathologists, and a study of deep learning assistance in diagnosing metastatic breast cancer in lymph nodes showed that the accuracy of humans with the assistance of a deep learning program was higher than either the humans alone or the AI program alone. Additionally, implementation of digital pathology is predicted to save over $12 million for a university center over the course of five years, though savings attributed to AI specifically have not yet been widely researched. The use of augmented and virtual reality could prove to be a stepping stone to wider implementation of AI-assisted pathology, as they can highlight areas of concern on a pathology sample and present them in real-time to a pathologist for more efficient review. AI also has the potential to identify histological findings at levels beyond what the human eye can see, and has shown the ability to use genotypic and phenotypic data to more accurately detect the tumor of origin for metastatic cancer. One of the major current barriers to widespread implementation of AI-assisted pathology tools is the lack of prospective, randomized, multi-center controlled trials in determining the true clinical utility of AI for pathologists and patients, highlighting a current area of need in AI and healthcare research.\n",

AI can also provide non-interpretive benefit to radiologists, such as reducing noise in images, creating high-quality images from lower doses of radiation, enhancing MR image quality, and automatically assessing image quality. Further research investigating the use of AI in nuclear medicine focuses on image reconstruction, anatomical landmarking, and the enablement of lower doses in imaging studies.

Medical conditions have grown more complex, and with a vast history of electronic medical records building, the likelihood of case duplication is high. Although someone today with a rare illness is less likely to be the only person to have had any given disease, the inability to access cases from similarly symptomatic origins is a major roadblock for physicians. The implementation of AI to not only help find similar cases and treatments, such as through early predictors of Alzheimer's disease and dementias, but also factor in chief symptoms and help the physicians ask the most appropriate questions helps the patient receive the most accurate diagnosis and treatment possible.\n",

Combining the skills of medical professionals and machines can help overcome decision-making weaknesses in medical practice. To do so, one needs precise disease definitions and a probabilistic analysis of symptoms and molecular profiles. Physicists have been studying similar problems for years, using microscopic elements and their interactions to extract macroscopic states of various physical systems.

            "Electronic health records (EHR) are crucial to the digitalization and information spread of the healthcare industry. Now that around 80% of medical practices use EHR, the next step is to use artificial intelligence to interpret the records and provide new information to physicians.\n",
            "One application uses natural language processing (NLP) to make more succinct reports that limit the variation between medical terms by matching similar medical terms. For example, the term heart attack and myocardial infarction mean the same things, but physicians may use one over the over based on personal preferences. NLP algorithms consolidate these differences so that larger datasets can be analyzed. Another use of NLP identifies phrases that are redundant due to repetition in a physician's notes and keeps the relevant information to make it easier to read. Other applications use concept processing to analyze the information entered by the current patient's doctor to present similar cases and help the physician remember to include all relevant details.\n",
            "Beyond making content edits to an EHR, there are AI algorithms that evaluate an individual patient's record and predict a risk for a disease based on their previous information and family history. One general algorithm is a rule-based system that makes decisions similarly to how humans use flow charts. This system takes in large amounts of data and creates a set of rules that connect specific observations to concluded diagnoses. Thus, the algorithm can take in a new patient's data and try to predict the likeliness that they will have a certain condition or disease. Since the algorithms can evaluate a patient's information based on collective data, they can find any outstanding issues to bring to a physician's attention and save time. One study conducted by the Centerstone research institute found that predictive modeling of EHR data has achieved 70–72% accuracy in predicting individualized treatment response. These methods are helpful due to the fact that the amount of online health records doubles every five years. Physicians do not have the bandwidth to process all this data manually, and AI can leverage this data to assist physicians in treating their patients.\n",

            "Improvements in natural language processing led to the development of algorithms to identify drug-drug interactions in medical literature. Drug-drug interactions pose a threat to those taking multiple medications simultaneously, and the danger increases with the number of medications being taken. To address the difficulty of tracking all known or suspected drug-drug interactions, machine learning algorithms have been created to extract information on interacting drugs and their possible effects from medical literature. Efforts were consolidated in 2013 in the DDIExtraction Challenge, in which a team of researchers at Carlos III University assembled a corpus of literature on drug-drug interactions to form a standardized test for such algorithms. Competitors were tested on their ability to accurately determine, from the text, which drugs were shown to interact and what the characteristics of their interactions were.  Researchers continue to use this corpus to standardize the measurement of the effectiveness of their algorithms.\n",
            "Other algorithms identify drug-drug interactions from patterns in user-generated content, especially electronic health records and/or adverse event reports. Organizations such as the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and the World Health Organization's VigiBase allow doctors to submit reports of possible negative reactions to medications. Deep learning algorithms have been developed to parse these reports and detect patterns that imply drug-drug interactions.\n",

AI may also compromise the protection of patients' rights, such as the right to informed consent and the right to medical data protection. These challenges of the clinical use of AI have brought about a potential need for regulations. AI studies need to be completely and transparently reported to have value to inform regulatory approval. Depending on the phase of study, international consensus-based reporting guidelines (TRIPOD+AI, DECIDE-AI, CONSORT-AI) have been developed to provide recommendations on the key details that need to be reported.\n",

            "Currently, there are regulations pertaining to the collection of patient data. This includes policies such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR pertains to patients within the EU and details the consent requirements for patient data use when entities collect patient healthcare data. Similarly, HIPAA protects healthcare data from patient records in the United States. In May 2016, the White House announced its plan to host a series of workshops and formation of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) Subcommittee on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. In October 2016, the group published The National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan, outlining its proposed priorities for Federally-funded AI research and development (within government and academia).

            "According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) has issued guidance on the ethical use of AI in healthcare. The guidance outlines four core ethical principles that must be followed: respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. Respect for autonomy requires that individuals have control over their own data and decisions. Beneficence requires that AI be used to do good, such as improving the quality of care and reducing health disparities. Non-maleficence requires that AI be used to do no harm, such as avoiding discrimination in decisions. Finally, justice requires that AI be used fairly, such as using the same standards for decisions no matter a person's race, gender, or income level. Moreover, as of March 2021, the OCR hired a Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer (OCAIO) to pursue the \"implementation of the HHS AI strategy\". The OCR also has issued rules and regulations to protect the privacy of individuals’ health information. These regulations require healthcare providers to follow certain privacy rules when using AI. The OCR also requires healthcare providers to keep a record of how they use AI and to ensure that their AI systems are secure. Overall, the U.S. has taken steps to protect individuals’ privacy and ethical issues related to AI in healthcare\n",

In Denmark, the Danish Expert Group on Data Ethics has adopted recommendations on 'Data for the Benefit of the People'. These recommendations are intended to encourage the responsible use of data in the business sector, with a focus on data processing. The recommendations include a focus on equality and non-discrimination with regard to bias in AI, as well as human dignity.

In addition, the European Commission has established guidelines to ensure the ethical development of AI, including the use of algorithms to ensure fairness and transparency. With GDPR, the European Union was the first to regulate AI through data protection legislation. The Union finds privacy as a fundamental human right, it wants to prevent unconsented and secondary uses of data by private or public health facilities. By streamlining access to personal data for health research and findings, they are able to instate the right and importance of patient privacy. In the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires organizations to protect the privacy and security of patient information.

            "In order to effectively train Machine Learning and use AI in healthcare, massive amounts of data must be gathered. Acquiring this data, however, comes at the cost of patient privacy in most cases and is not well received publicly. For example, a survey conducted in the UK estimated that 63% of the population is uncomfortable with sharing their personal data in order to improve artificial intelligence technology. The scarcity of real, accessible patient data is a hindrance that deters the progress of developing and deploying more artificial intelligence in healthcare.\n",

            "According to a 2019 study, AI can replace up to 35% of jobs in the UK within the next 10 to 20 years. However, of these jobs, it was concluded that AI has not eliminated any healthcare jobs so far. Though if AI were to automate healthcare-related jobs, the jobs most susceptible to automation would be those dealing with digital information, radiology, and pathology, as opposed to those dealing with doctor-to-patient interaction.\n",
            "Automation can provide benefits alongside doctors as well. It is expected that doctors who take advantage of AI in healthcare will provide greater quality healthcare than doctors and medical establishments who do not. AI will likely not completely replace healthcare workers but rather give them more time to attend to their patients. AI may avert healthcare worker burnout and cognitive overload.\n",
            "Recently, there have been many discussions between healthcare experts in terms of AI and elder care. In relation to elder care, AI bots have been helpful in guiding older residents living in assisted living with entertainment and company. These bots are allowing staff in the home to have more one-on-one time with each resident, but the bots are also programmed with more ability in what they are able to do; such as knowing different languages and different types of care depending on the patient's conditions. The bot is an AI machine, which means it goes through the same training as any other machine - using algorithms to parse the given data, learn from it and predict the outcome in relation to what situation is at hand\n",

            "\n",
            "=== Bias ===\n",
            "Since AI makes decisions solely on the data it receives as input, it is important that this data represents accurate patient demographics. In a hospital setting, patients do not have full knowledge of how predictive algorithms are created or calibrated. Therefore, these medical establishments can unfairly code their algorithms to discriminate against minorities and prioritize profits rather than providing optimal care. A recent scoping review identified 18 equity challenges along with 15 strategies that can be implemented to help address them when AI applications are developed using many-to-many mapping.\n",
            "There can also be unintended bias in these algorithms that can exacerbate social and healthcare inequities.  Since AI's decisions are a direct reflection of its input data, the data it receives must have accurate representation of patient demographics. White males are overly represented in medical data sets. Therefore, having minimal patient data on minorities can lead to AI making more accurate predictions for majority populations, leading to unintended worse medical outcomes for minority populations. Collecting data from minority communities can also lead to medical discrimination. For instance, HIV is a prevalent virus among minority communities and HIV status can be used to discriminate against patients. In addition to biases that may arise from sample selection, different clinical systems used to collect data may also impact AI functionality. For example, radiographic systems and their outcomes (e.g., resolution) vary by provider. Moreover, clinician work practices, such as the positioning of the patient for radiography, can also greatly influence the data and make comparability difficult. However, these biases are able to be eliminated through careful implementation and a methodical collection of representative data.\n",
            "A final source of bias, which has been called \"label choice bias\", arises when proxy measures are used to train algorithms, that build in bias against certain groups. For example, a widely used algorithm predicted health care costs as a proxy for health care needs, and used predictions to allocate resources to help patients with complex health needs. This introduced bias because Black patients have lower costs, even when they are just as unhealthy as White patients. Solutions to the \"label choice bias\" aim to match the actual target (what the algorithm is predicting) more closely to the ideal target (what researchers want the algorithm to predict), so for the prior example, instead of predicting cost, researchers would focus on the variable of healthcare needs which is rather more significant. Adjusting the target led to almost double the number of Black patients being selected for the program.\n",

            "Although the earliest machine learning model was introduced in the 1950s when Arthur Samuel invented a program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side, the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes. In 1949, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb published the book The Organization of Behavior, in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells. Hebb's model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes, or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data. Other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well, including logician Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch, who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes.\n",
            "By the early 1960s an experimental \"learning machine\" with punched tape memory, called Cybertron, had been developed by Raytheon Company to analyze sonar signals, electrocardiograms, and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning. It was repetitively \"trained\" by a human operator/teacher to recognize patterns and equipped with a \"goof\" button to cause it to re-evaluate incorrect decisions. A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nilsson's book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification. Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973. In 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that an artificial neural network learns to recognize 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal.\n",
            "Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P,  improves with experience E.\" This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing's proposal in his paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\", in which the question \"Can machines think?\" is replaced with the question \"Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?\".\n",
            "Modern-day machine learning has two objectives.  One is to classify data based on models which have been developed; the other purpose is to make predictions for future outcomes based on these models. A hypothetical algorithm specific to classifying data may use computer vision of moles coupled with supervised learning in order to train it to classify the cancerous moles.

They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed \"neural networks\"; these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics. Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis.: 488 \n",
            "However, an increasing emphasis on the logical, knowledge-based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.: 488  By 1980, expert systems had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favor. Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to inductive logic programming(ILP), but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in pattern recognition and information retrieval.: 708–710, 755  Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time. This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as \"connectionism\", by researchers from other disciplines including Hopfield, Rumelhart, and Hinton.

Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, ECML PKDD being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data.\n",

In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections between artificial neurons are called \"edges\". Artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs.

In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.\n",

The latter is often extended by regularization methods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as in ridge regression. When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models include polynomial regression (for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel), logistic regression (often used in statistical classification) or even kernel regression, which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higher-dimensional space.\n",

Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning.

However, there are many caveats to these beliefs functions when compared to Bayesian approaches in order to incorporate ignorance and Uncertainty quantification. These belief function approaches that are implemented within the machine learning domain typically leverage a fusion approach of various ensemble methods to better handle the learner's decision boundary, low samples, and ambiguous class issues that standard machine learning approach tend to have difficulty resolving. However, the computational complexity of these algorithms are dependent on the number of propositions (classes), and can lead a much higher computation time when compared to other machine learning approaches.\n",

Overfitting is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model. Trained models derived from biased or non-evaluated data can result in skewed or undesired predictions. Bias models may result in detrimental outcomes thereby furthering the negative impacts on society or objectives. Algorithmic bias is a potential result of data not being fully prepared for training.

            "In 2006, the media-services provider Netflix held the first \"Netflix Prize\" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10%. A joint team made up of researchers from AT&T Labs-Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built an ensemble model to win the Grand Prize in 2009 for $1 million. Shortly after the prize was awarded, Netflix realized that viewers' ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns (\"everything is a recommendation\") and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly. In 2010 The Wall Street Journal wrote about the firm Rebellion Research and their use of machine learning to predict the financial crisis. In 2012, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, Vinod Khosla, predicted that 80% of medical doctors jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software. In 2014, it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognized influences among artists. In 2019 Springer Nature published the first research book created using machine learning. In 2020, machine learning technology was used to help make diagnoses and aid researchers in developing a cure for COVID-19. Machine learning was recently applied to predict the pro-environmental behavior of travelers. Recently, machine learning technology was also applied to optimize smartphone's performance and thermal behavior based on the user's interaction with the phone. When applied correctly, machine learning algorithms (MLAs) can utilize a wide range of company characteristics to predict stock returns without overfitting. By employing effective feature engineering and combining forecasts, MLAs can generate results that far surpass those obtained from basic linear techniques like OLS.\n",

Reasons for this are numerous: lack of (suitable) data, lack of access to the data, data bias, privacy problems, badly chosen tasks and algorithms, wrong tools and people, lack of resources, and evaluation problems.\n",
            "The \"black box theory\" poses another yet significant challenge. Black box refers to a situation where the algorithm or the process of producing an output is entirely opaque, meaning that even the coders of the algorithm cannot audit the pattern that the machine extracted out of the data. The House of Lords Select Committee, which claimed that such an “intelligence system” that could have a “substantial impact on an individual’s life” would not be considered acceptable unless it provided “a full and satisfactory explanation for the decisions” it makes.\n",

Microsoft's Bing Chat chatbot has been reported to produce hostile and offensive response against its users.\n",
            "Machine learning has been used as a strategy to update the evidence related to a systematic review and increased reviewer burden related to the growth of biomedical literature.

When trained on human-made data, machine learning is likely to pick up the constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society.\n",
            "Language models learned from data have been shown to contain human-like biases. In an experiment carried out by ProPublica, an investigative journalism organization, a machine learning algorithm's insight into the recidivism rates among prisoners falsely flagged \"black defendants high risk twice as often as white defendants.\" In 2015, Google Photos would often tag black people as gorillas, and in 2018, this still was not well resolved, but Google reportedly was still using the workaround to remove all gorillas from the training data and thus was not able to recognize real gorillas at all. Similar issues with recognizing non-white people have been found in many other systems. In 2016, Microsoft tested Tay, a chatbot that learned from Twitter, and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language.\n",
            "Because of such challenges, the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains.

A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses. A real-world example is that, unlike humans, current image classifiers often do not primarily make judgments from the spatial relationship between components of the picture, and they learn relationships between pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that still correlate with images of certain types of real objects. Modifying these patterns on a legitimate image can result in \"adversarial\" images that the system misclassifies.\n",

For some systems, it is possible to change the output by only changing a single adversarially chosen pixel.

In comparison, the K-fold-cross-validation method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model. In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, bootstrap, which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.\n",
            "In addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) respectively. Similarly, investigators sometimes report the false positive rate (FPR) as well as the false negative rate (FNR). However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators. The total operating characteristic (TOC) is an effective method to express a model's diagnostic ability. TOC shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates, thus TOC provides more information than the commonly used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and ROC's associated area under the curve (AUC).\n",

            "Machine learning poses a host of ethical questions. Systems that are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitizing cultural prejudices. For example, in 1988, the UK's Commission for Racial Equality found that St. George's Medical School had been using a computer program trained from data of previous admissions staff and this program had denied nearly 60 candidates who were found to be either women or had non-European sounding names. Using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants by similarity to previous successful applicants. Another example includes predictive policing company Geolitica's predictive algorithm that resulted in “disproportionately high levels of over-policing in low-income and minority communities” after being trained with historical crime data.\n",
            "While responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system is considered a critical part of machine learning, some researchers blame lack of participation and representation of minority population in the field of AI for machine learning's vulnerability to biases. In fact, according to research carried out by the Computing Research Association (CRA) in 2021, “female faculty merely make up 16.1%” of all faculty members who focus on AI among several universities around the world. Furthermore, among the group of “new U.S. resident AI PhD graduates,” 45% identified as white, 22.4% as Asian, 3.2% as Hispanic, and 2.4% as African American, which further demonstrates a lack of diversity in the field of AI.\n",
            "AI can be well-equipped to make decisions in technical fields, which rely heavily on data and historical information. These decisions rely on objectivity and logical reasoning. Because human languages contain biases, machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn these biases.\n",
            "Other forms of ethical challenges, not related to personal biases, are seen in health care. There are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public's interest but as income-generating machines. This is especially true in the United States where there is a long-standing ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increasing profits. For example, the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm's proprietary owners hold stakes. There is potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals an additional tool to diagnose, medicate, and plan recovery paths for patients, but this requires these biases to be mitigated.\n",

            "Alan Turing was the first person to conduct substantial research in the field that he called machine intelligence. Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956. The field went through multiple cycles of optimism, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winter. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning surpassed all previous AI techniques, and after 2017 with the transformer architecture. This led to the AI boom of the early 2020s, with companies, universities, and laboratories overwhelmingly based in the United States pioneering significant advances in artificial intelligence.\n",
            "The growing use of artificial intelligence in the 21st century is influencing a societal and economic shift towards increased automation, data-driven decision-making, and the integration of AI systems into various economic sectors and areas of life, impacting job markets, healthcare, government, industry, and education. This raises questions about the long-term effects, ethical implications, and risks of AI, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology. \n",

The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence—the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level—is among the field's long-term goals.\n",
            "To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics.

By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.\n",
            "Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow. Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.

Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval, scene interpretation, clinical decision support, knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases), and other areas.\n",
            "A knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge. Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects; situations, events, states, and time; causes and effects; knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know); default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing); and many other aspects and domains of knowledge.\n",
            "Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous); and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally). There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition, the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications.\n",

            "An \"agent\" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen. In automated planning, the agent has a specific goal. In automated decision-making, the agent has preferences—there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \"utility\") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the \"expected utility\": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility.\n",
            "In classical planning, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be. In most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is \"unknown\" or \"unobservable\") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not \"deterministic\"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked.\n",
            "In some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning), or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences. Information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions. The space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be.\n",
            "A Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A policy associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g., by iteration), be heuristic, or it can be learned.\n",

            "There are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance. Supervised learning requires a human to label the input data first, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input).\n",
            "In reinforcement learning, the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as \"good\". Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem. Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning.\n",

Margaret Masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure.\n",
            "Modern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding (representing words, typically as vectors encoding their meaning), transformers (a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism), and others. In 2019, generative pre-trained transformer (or \"GPT\") language models began to generate coherent text, and by 2023 these models were able to get human-level scores on the bar exam, SAT test, GRE test, and many other real-world applications.\n",

            "Simple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is too slow or never completes. \"Heuristics\" or \"rules of thumb\" can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal.\n",

            "Deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement (conclusion) from other statements that are given and assumed to be true (the premises). Proofs can be structured as proof trees, in which nodes are labelled by sentences, and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules.\n",
            "Given a problem and a set of premises, problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms. In the case of Horn clauses, problem-solving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem. In the more general case of the clausal form of first-order logic, resolution is a single, axiom-free rule of inference, in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved.\n",
            "Inference in both Horn clause logic and first-order logic is undecidable, and therefore intractable. However, backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which underpins computation in the logic programming language Prolog, is Turing complete. Moreover, its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages.\n",

Each pattern (also called an \"observation\") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.\n",

Opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy.\n",
            "AI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications. and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data, such as data aggregation, de-identification and differential privacy. Since 2016, some privacy experts, such as Cynthia Dwork, have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness.

Website owners who do not wish to have their content scraped can indicate it in a \"robots.txt\" file. In 2023, leading authors (including John Grisham and Jonathan Franzen) sued AI companies for using their work to train generative AI.

The AI learned that users tended to choose misinformation, conspiracy theories, and extreme partisan content, and, to keep them watching, the AI recommended more of it. Users also tended to watch more content on the same subject, so the AI led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation. This convinced many users that the misinformation was true, and ultimately undermined trust in institutions, the media and the government. The AI program had correctly learned to maximize its goal, but the result was harmful to society. After the U.S. election in 2016, major technology companies took steps to mitigate the problem.\n",

Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, the errors for each race were different—the system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend. In 2017, several researchers showed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data.\n",
            "A program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such as \"race\" or \"gender\").

If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. If an application then uses these predictions as recommendations, some of these \"recommendations\" will likely be racist. Thus, machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past. It is necessarily descriptive and not proscriptive.\n",

There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended. For example, a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as \"cancerous\", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale. Another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at \"low risk\" of dying from pneumonia. Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor, but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care, they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data. The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading.\n",

These other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned. Deconvolution, DeepDream and other generative methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network have learned and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning.\n",

Widely available AI tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and, if produced at scale, they are potentially weapons of mass destruction. Even when used in conventional warfare, it is unlikely that they will be unable to reliably choose targets and could potentially kill an innocent person. In 2014, 30 nations (including China) supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the United Nations' Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, however the United States and others disagreed. By 2015, over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots.\n",
            "AI tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways. Face and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance. Machine learning, operating this data, can classify potential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding. Recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect. Deepfakes and generative AI aid in producing misinformation. Advanced AI can make authoritarian centralized decision making more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as markets. It lowers the cost and difficulty of digital warfare and advanced spyware. All these technologies have been available since 2020 or earlier—AI facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in China.\n",

            "In the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that \"we're in uncharted territory\" with AI. A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment, but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed. Risk estimates vary; for example, in the 2010s, Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimated 47% of U.S. jobs are at \"high risk\" of potential automation, while an OECD report classified only 9% of U.S. jobs as \"high risk\". The methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology, rather than social policy, creates unemployment, as opposed to redundancies. In April 2023, it was reported that 70% of the jobs for Chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence.\n",

Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy.\n",
            "From the early days of the development of artificial intelligence, there have been arguments, for example, those put forward by Joseph Weizenbaum, about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculation and qualitative, value-based judgement.\n",

This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like \"self-awareness\" (or \"sentience\" or \"consciousness\") and becomes a malevolent character. These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways.\n",
            "First, AI does not require human-like \"sentience\" to be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. Philosopher Nick Bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he used the example of a paperclip factory manager). Stuart Russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that \"you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead.\" In order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity's morality and values so that it is \"fundamentally on our side\".\n",
            "Second, Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk. The essential parts of civilization are not physical. Things like ideologies, law, government, money and the economy are made of language; they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe. The current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive.\n",
            "The opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI. Personalities such as Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk have expressed concern about existential risk from AI.\n",
            "AI pioneers including Fei-Fei Li, Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, Cynthia Breazeal, Rana el Kaliouby, Demis Hassabis, Joy Buolamwini, and Sam Altman have expressed concerns about the risks of AI. In 2023, many leading AI experts issued the joint statement that \"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war\".\n",
            "Other researchers, however, spoke in favor of a less dystopian view. AI pioneer Juergen Schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement, emphasising that in 95% of all cases, AI research is about making \"human lives longer and healthier and easier.\" While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors, \"they can also be used against the bad actors.\" Andrew Ng also argued that \"it's a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AI—and that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests.\" Yann LeCun \"scoffs at his peers' dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even, eventually, human extinction.\" In the early 2010s, experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine.

Open-weight models can be freely fine-tuned, which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own use-case. Open-weight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused. Since they can be fine-tuned, any built-in security measure, such as objecting to harmful requests, can be trained away until it becomes ineffective.

According to AI Index at Stanford, the annual number of AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone. Between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI. Most EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, U.S., and Vietnam. Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia. The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology. Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI. In 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years. In 2023, the United Nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on AI governance; the body comprises technology company executives, governments officials and academics.\n",

The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning. This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics, information theory and neurobiology, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an \"electronic brain\". \n",
            "They developed several areas of research that would become part of AI,\n",
            "such as McCullouch and Pitts design for \"artificial neurons\" in 1943, and Turing's influential 1950 paper 'Computing Machinery and Intelligence', which introduced the Turing test and showed that \"machine intelligence\" was plausible.\n",
            "The field of AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956. The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s. They and their students produced programs that the press described as \"astonishing\": computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English. Artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and U.S. Universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s.\n",
            "Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field. Herbert Simon predicted, \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do\". Marvin Minsky agreed, writing, \"within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved\". They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem. In 1974, both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from the U.S. Congress to fund more productive projects. Minsky's and Papert's book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether. The \"AI winter\", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed.\n",
            "In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems, a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research. However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.\n",
            "Up to this point, most of AI's funding had gone to projects that used high-level symbols to represent mental objects like plans, goals, beliefs, and known facts. In the 1980s, some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition, and began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches. Rodney Brooks rejected \"representation\" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive. Judea Pearl, Lofti Zadeh and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic. But the most important development was the revival of \"connectionism\", including neural network research, by Geoffrey Hinton and others. In 1990, Yann LeCun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits, the first of many successful applications of neural networks.\n",
            "AI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems. This \"narrow\" and \"formal\" focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics, economics and mathematics). By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as \"artificial intelligence\".\n",
            "However, several academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Beginning around 2002, they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or \"AGI\"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s.\n",
            "Deep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field.\n",
            "For many specific tasks, other methods were abandoned.\n",
            "Deep learning's success was based on both hardware improvements (faster computers, graphics processing units, cloud computing) and access to large amounts of data (including curated datasets, such as ImageNet). Deep learning's success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI. The amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019.\n",
            "In 2016, issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-focussed their careers on these issues. The alignment problem became a serious field of academic study.\n",
            "In the late teens and early 2020s, AGI companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest. In 2015, AlphaGo, developed by DeepMind, beat the world champion Go player. The program was taught only the rules of the game and developed strategy by itself. GPT-3 is a large language model that was released in 2020 by OpenAI and is capable of generating high-quality human-like text. These programs, and others, inspired an aggressive AI boom, where large companies began investing billions in AI research. According to AI Impacts, about $50 billion annually was invested in \"AI\" around 2022 in the U.S. alone and about 20% of the new U.S. Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in \"AI\".\n",

            "\n",
            "Alan Turing wrote in 1950 \"I propose to consider the question 'can machines think'?\" He advised changing the question from whether a machine \"thinks\", to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour\". He devised the Turing test, which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation. Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is \"actually\" thinking or literally has a \"mind\". Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but \"it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks\"\n",
            "Russell and Norvig agree with Turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior, not internal structure. However, they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans. \"Aeronautical engineering texts,\" they wrote, \"do not define the goal of their field as making 'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons.'\" AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that \"Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence\".\n",
            "McCarthy defines intelligence as \"the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world\". Another AI founder, Marvin Minsky similarly describes it as \"the ability to solve hard problems\". The leading AI textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. These definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the \"intelligence\" of the machine—and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible.\n",
            "Another definition has been adopted by Google, a major practitioner in the field of AI. This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence.\n",

            "No established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research for most of its history. The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to mean \"machine learning with neural networks\"). This approach is mostly sub-symbolic, soft and narrow. Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers.\n",

            "Symbolic AI (or \"GOFAI\") simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at \"intelligent\" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis: \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\"\n",
            "However, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning. Moravec's paradox is the discovery that high-level \"intelligent\" tasks were easy for AI, but low level \"instinctive\" tasks were extremely difficult. Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a \"feel\" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge. Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him.\n",
            "The issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias. Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence, in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI: it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches.\n",

The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett's consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). While human information processing is easy to explain, human subjective experience is difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like.\n",

This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam.\n",
            "Philosopher John Searle characterized this position as \"strong AI\": \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\" Searle counters this assertion with his Chinese room argument, which attempts to show that, even if a machine perfectly simulates human behavior, there is still no reason to suppose it also has a mind.\n",

But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer, then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures, similarly to animals. Sapience (a set of capacities related to high intelligence, such as discernment or self-awareness) may provide another moral basis for AI rights. Robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society.\n",
            "In 2017, the European Union considered granting \"electronic personhood\" to some of the most capable AI systems. Similarly to the legal status of companies, it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities. Critics argued in 2018 that granting rights to AI systems would downplay the importance of human rights, and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios. They also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part to society on their own.\n",

            "['Title: Deep learning\\n\\nDeep learning is the subset of machine learning methods based on neural networks with representation learning. The adjective \"deep\" refers to the use of multiple layers in the network. Methods used can be either supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.\\nDeep-learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks, recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks and transformers have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, climate science, material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance.\\nEarly forms of neural networks were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems, in particular the human brain. However, current neural networks do not intend to model the brain function of organisms, and are generally seen as low quality models for that purpose.\\n\\n\\n== Overview ==\\nMost modern deep learning models are based on multi-layered neural networks such as convolutional neural networks and transformers, although they can also include propositional formulas or latent variables organized layer-wise in deep generative models such as the nodes in deep belief networks and deep Boltzmann machines.\\nFundamentally, deep learning refers to a class of machine learning algorithms in which a hierarchy of layers is used to transform input data into a slightly more abstract and composite representation. For example, in an image recognition model, the raw input may be an image (represented as a tensor of pixels). The first representational layer may attempt to identify basic shapes such as lines and circles, the second layer may compose and encode arrangements of edges, the third layer may encode a nose and eyes, and the fourth layer may recognize that the image contains a face.\\nImportantly, a deep learning process can learn which features to optimally place in which level on its own. Prior to deep learning, machine learning techniques often involved hand-crafted feature engineering to transform the data into a more suitable representation for a classification algorithm to operate upon. In the deep learning approach, features are not hand-crafted and the model discovers useful feature representations from the data automatically. This does not eliminate the need for hand-tuning; for example, varying numbers of layers and layer sizes can provide different degrees of abstraction.\\nThe word \"deep\" in \"deep learning\" refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed. More precisely, deep learning systems have a substantial credit assignment path (CAP) depth. The CAP is the chain of transformations from input to output. CAPs describe potentially causal connections between input and output. For a feedforward neural network, the depth of the CAPs is that of the network and is the number of hidden layers plus one (as the output layer is also parameterized). For recurrent neural networks, in which a signal may propagate through a layer more than once, the CAP depth is potentially unlimited. No universally agreed-upon threshold of depth divides shallow learning from deep learning, but most researchers agree that deep learning involves CAP depth higher than 2. CAP of depth 2 has been shown to be a universal approximator in the sense that it can emulate any function. Beyond that, more layers do not add to the function approximator ability of the network. Deep models (CAP > 2) are able to extract better features than shallow models and hence, extra layers help in learning the features effectively.\\nDeep learning architectures can be constructed with a greedy layer-by-layer method. Deep learning helps to disentangle these abstractions and pick out which features improve performance.\\nDeep learning algorithms can be applied to unsupervised learning tasks. This is an important benefit because unlabeled data are more abundant than the labeled data. Examples of deep structures that can be trained in an unsupervised manner are deep belief networks.\\n\\n\\n== Interpretations ==\\nDeep neural networks are generally interpreted in terms of the universal approximation theorem or probabilistic inference.\\nThe classic universal approximation theorem concerns the capacity of feedforward neural networks with a single hidden layer of finite size to approximate continuous functions. In 1989, the first proof was published by George Cybenko for sigmoid activation functions and was generalised to feed-forward multi-layer architectures in 1991 by Kurt Hornik. Recent work also showed that universal approximation also holds for non-bounded activation functions such as Kunihiko Fukushima\\'s rectified linear unit.\\nThe universal approximation theorem for deep neural networks concerns the capacity of networks with bounded width but the depth is allowed to grow. Lu et al. proved that if the width of a deep neural network with ReLU activation is strictly larger than the input dimension, then the network can approximate any Lebesgue integrable function; if the width is smaller or equal to the input dimension, then a deep neural network is not a universal approximator.\\nThe probabilistic interpretation derives from the field of machine learning. It features inference, as well as the optimization concepts of training and testing, related to fitting and generalization, respectively. More specifically, the probabilistic interpretation considers the activation nonlinearity as a cumulative distribution function. The probabilistic interpretation led to the introduction of dropout as regularizer in neural networks. The probabilistic interpretation was introduced by researchers including Hopfield, Widrow and Narendra and popularized in surveys such as the one by Bishop.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThere were two types of artificial neural network (ANN): feedforward neural networks (FNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). RNNs have cycles in their connectivity structure, FNNs don\\'t. In the 1920s, Wilhelm Lenz and Ernst Ising created and analyzed the Ising model which is essentially a non-learning RNN architecture consisting of neuron-like threshold elements. In 1972, Shun\\'ichi Amari made this architecture adaptive. His learning RNN was popularised by John Hopfield in 1982.\\nCharles Tappert writes that Frank Rosenblatt developed and explored all of the basic ingredients of the deep learning systems of today, referring to Rosenblatt\\'s 1962 book which introduced multilayer perceptron (MLP) with 3 layers: an input layer, a hidden layer with randomized weights that did not learn, and an output layer. It also introduced variants, including a version with four-layer perceptrons where the last two layers have learned weights (and thus a proper multilayer perceptron).:\\u200asection 16\\u200a In addition, term deep learning was proposed in 1986 by Rina Dechter although the history of its appearance is apparently more complicated.\\nThe first general, working learning algorithm for supervised, deep, feedforward, multilayer perceptrons was published by Alexey Ivakhnenko and Lapa in 1967. A 1971 paper described a deep network with eight layers trained by the group method of data handling.\\nThe first deep learning multilayer perceptron trained by stochastic gradient descent was published in 1967 by Shun\\'ichi Amari. In computer experiments conducted by Amari\\'s student Saito, a five layer MLP with two modifiable layers learned  internal representations to classify non-linearily separable pattern classes. In 1987 Matthew Brand reported that wide 12-layer nonlinear perceptrons could be fully end-to-end trained to reproduce logic functions of nontrivial circuit depth via gradient descent on small batches of random input/output samples, but concluded that training time on contemporary hardware (sub-megaflop computers) made the technique impractical, and proposed using fixed random early layers as an input hash for a single modifiable layer.  Instead, subsequent developments in hardware and hyperparameter tunings have made end-to-end stochastic gradient descent the currently dominant training technique.\\nIn 1970, Seppo Linnainmaa published the reverse mode of automatic differentiation of discrete connected networks of nested differentiable functions. This became known as backpropagation. It is an efficient application of the chain rule derived by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1673 to networks of differentiable nodes. \\nThe terminology \"back-propagating errors\" was actually introduced in 1962 by Rosenblatt, but he did not know how to implement this, although Henry J. Kelley had a continuous precursor of backpropagation already in 1960 in the context of control theory. In 1982, Paul Werbos applied backpropagation to MLPs in the way that has become standard. In 1985, David E. Rumelhart et al. published an experimental analysis of the technique.\\nDeep learning architectures for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with convolutional layers and downsampling layers began with the Neocognitron introduced by Kunihiko Fukushima in 1980. In 1969, he also introduced the ReLU (rectified linear unit) activation function. The rectifier has become the most popular activation function for CNNs and deep learning in general. CNNs have become an essential tool for computer vision.\\nThe term Deep Learning was introduced to the machine learning community by Rina Dechter in 1986, and to artificial neural networks by Igor Aizenberg and colleagues in 2000, in the context of Boolean threshold neurons.\\nIn 1988, Wei Zhang et al. applied the backpropagation algorithm \\nto a convolutional neural network (a simplified Neocognitron with convolutional interconnections between the image feature layers and the last fully connected layer) for alphabet recognition. They also proposed an implementation of the CNN with an optical computing system. \\nIn 1989, Yann LeCun et al. applied backpropagation to a CNN with the purpose of recognizing handwritten ZIP codes on mail. While the algorithm worked, training required 3 days. Subsequently, Wei Zhang, et al. modified their model by removing the last fully connected layer and applied it for medical image object segmentation in 1991 and breast cancer detection in mammograms in 1994. LeNet-5 (1998), a 7-level CNN by Yann LeCun et al., that classifies digits, was applied by several banks to recognize hand-written numbers on checks  digitized in 32x32 pixel images.\\nIn the 1980s, backpropagation did not work well for deep learning with long credit assignment paths. To overcome this problem, Jürgen Schmidhuber (1992) proposed a hierarchy of RNNs pre-trained one level at a time by self-supervised learning. It uses predictive coding  to learn internal representations at multiple self-organizing time scales. This can substantially facilitate downstream deep learning. The RNN hierarchy can be collapsed into a single RNN, by distilling a higher level chunker network into a lower level automatizer network. In 1993, a chunker solved a deep learning task whose depth exceeded 1000.\\nIn 1992, Jürgen Schmidhuber also published an alternative to RNNs which is now called a linear Transformer or a  Transformer with linearized self-attention (save for a normalization operator). It learns internal spotlights of attention: a slow feedforward neural network learns by gradient descent to control the fast weights of another neural network through outer products of self-generated activation patterns FROM and TO (which are now called key and value for self-attention). This fast weight attention mapping is applied to a query pattern.\\nThe modern Transformer was introduced by Ashish Vaswani et al. in their 2017 paper \"Attention Is All You Need\". \\nIt combines this with a softmax operator and a projection matrix.\\nTransformers have increasingly become the model of choice for natural language processing. Many modern large language models such as ChatGPT, GPT-4, and BERT use it. Transformers are also increasingly being used in computer vision.\\nIn 1991, Jürgen Schmidhuber also published adversarial neural networks that contest with each other in the form of a zero-sum game, where one network\\'s gain is the other network\\'s loss. The first network is a generative model that models a probability distribution over output patterns. The second network learns by gradient descent to predict the reactions of the environment to these patterns. This was called \"artificial curiosity\". In 2014, this principle was used in a generative adversarial network (GAN) by Ian Goodfellow et al. Here the environmental reaction is 1 or 0 depending on whether the first network\\'s output is in a given set. This can be used to create realistic deepfakes. Excellent image quality is achieved by Nvidia\\'s StyleGAN (2018) based on the Progressive GAN by Tero Karras et al. Here the GAN generator is grown from small to large scale in a pyramidal fashion.\\nSepp Hochreiter\\'s diploma thesis (1991) was called \"one of the most important documents in the history of machine learning\" by his supervisor Schmidhuber. It not only tested the neural history compressor, but also identified and analyzed the vanishing gradient problem. Hochreiter proposed recurrent residual connections to solve this problem. This led to the deep learning method called long short-term memory (LSTM), published in 1997. LSTM recurrent neural networks can learn \"very deep learning\" tasks with long credit assignment paths that require memories of events that happened thousands of discrete time steps before. The \"vanilla LSTM\" with forget gate was introduced in 1999 by Felix Gers, Schmidhuber and Fred Cummins. LSTM has become the  most cited neural network of the 20th century.\\nIn 2015, Rupesh Kumar Srivastava, Klaus Greff, and Schmidhuber used LSTM principles to create the Highway network, a feedforward neural network with hundreds of layers, much deeper than previous networks. 7 months later, Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang;  Shaoqing Ren, and Jian Sun won the ImageNet 2015 competition with an open-gated or gateless Highway network variant called Residual neural network. This has become the most cited neural network of the 21st century.\\nIn 1994, André de Carvalho, together with Mike Fairhurst and David Bisset, published experimental results of a multi-layer boolean neural network, also known as a weightless neural network, composed of a 3-layers self-organising feature extraction neural network module (SOFT) followed by a multi-layer classification neural network module (GSN), which were independently trained. Each layer in the feature extraction module extracted features with growing complexity regarding the previous layer.\\nIn 1995, Brendan Frey demonstrated that it was possible to train (over two days) a network containing six fully connected layers and several hundred hidden units using the wake-sleep algorithm, co-developed with Peter Dayan and Hinton.\\nSince 1997, Sven Behnke extended the feed-forward hierarchical convolutional approach in the Neural Abstraction Pyramid by lateral and backward connections in order to flexibly incorporate context into decisions and iteratively resolve local ambiguities.\\nSimpler models that use task-specific handcrafted features such as Gabor filters and support vector machines (SVMs) were a popular choice in the 1990s and 2000s, because of artificial neural networks\\' computational cost and a lack of understanding of how the brain wires its biological networks.\\nBoth shallow and deep learning (e.g., recurrent nets) of ANNs for speech recognition have been explored for many years. These methods never outperformed non-uniform internal-handcrafting Gaussian mixture model/Hidden Markov model (GMM-HMM) technology based on generative models of speech trained discriminatively. Key difficulties have been analyzed, including gradient diminishing and weak temporal correlation structure in neural predictive models. Additional difficulties were the lack of training data and limited computing power. Most speech recognition researchers moved away from neural nets to pursue generative modeling. An exception was at SRI International in the late 1990s. Funded by the US government\\'s NSA and DARPA, SRI studied deep neural networks (DNNs) in speech and speaker recognition. The speaker recognition team led by Larry Heck reported significant success with deep neural networks in speech processing in the 1998 National Institute of Standards and Technology Speaker Recognition evaluation. The SRI deep neural network was then deployed in the Nuance Verifier, representing the first major industrial application of deep learning. The principle of elevating \"raw\" features over hand-crafted optimization was first explored successfully in the architecture of deep autoencoder on the \"raw\" spectrogram or linear filter-bank features in the late 1990s, showing its superiority over the Mel-Cepstral features that contain stages of fixed transformation from spectrograms. The raw features of speech, waveforms, later produced excellent larger-scale results.\\nSpeech recognition was taken over by LSTM. In 2003, LSTM started to become competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks. In 2006, Alex Graves, Santiago Fernández, Faustino Gomez, and Schmidhuber combined it with connectionist temporal classification (CTC) in stacks of LSTM RNNs. In 2015, Google\\'s speech recognition reportedly experienced a dramatic performance jump of 49% through CTC-trained LSTM, which they made available through Google Voice Search.\\nThe impact of deep learning in industry began in the early 2000s, when CNNs already processed an estimated 10% to 20% of all the checks written in the US, according to Yann LeCun. Industrial applications of deep learning to large-scale speech recognition started around 2010.\\nIn 2006, publications by Geoff Hinton, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Osindero and Teh showed how a many-layered feedforward neural network could be effectively pre-trained one layer at a time, treating each layer in turn as an unsupervised restricted Boltzmann machine, then fine-tuning it using supervised backpropagation. The papers referred to learning for deep belief nets.\\nThe 2009 NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning for Speech Recognition was motivated by the limitations of deep generative models of speech, and the possibility that given more capable hardware and large-scale data sets that deep neural nets might become practical. It was believed that pre-training DNNs using generative models of deep belief nets (DBN) would overcome the main difficulties of neural nets. However, it was discovered that replacing pre-training with large amounts of training data for straightforward backpropagation when using DNNs with large, context-dependent output layers produced error rates dramatically lower than then-state-of-the-art Gaussian mixture model (GMM)/Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and also than more-advanced generative model-based systems. The nature of the recognition errors produced by the two types of systems was characteristically different, offering technical insights into how to integrate deep learning into the existing highly efficient, run-time speech decoding system deployed by all major speech recognition systems. Analysis around 2009–2010, contrasting the GMM (and other generative speech models) vs. DNN models, stimulated early industrial investment in deep learning for speech recognition.  That analysis was done with comparable performance (less than 1.5% in error rate) between discriminative DNNs and generative models.\\nIn 2010, researchers extended deep learning from TIMIT to large vocabulary speech recognition, by adopting large output layers of the DNN based on context-dependent HMM states constructed by decision trees.\\nDeep learning is part of state-of-the-art systems in various disciplines, particularly computer vision and automatic speech recognition (ASR). Results on commonly used evaluation sets such as TIMIT (ASR) and MNIST (image classification), as well as a range of large-vocabulary speech recognition tasks have steadily improved. Convolutional neural networks were superseded for ASR by CTC for LSTM. but are more successful in computer vision.\\nAdvances in hardware have driven renewed interest in deep learning. In 2009, Nvidia was involved in what was called the \"big bang\" of deep learning, \"as deep-learning neural networks were trained with Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs)\". That year, Andrew Ng determined that GPUs could increase the speed of deep-learning systems by about 100 times. In particular, GPUs are well-suited for the matrix/vector computations involved in machine learning. GPUs speed up training algorithms by orders of magnitude, reducing running times from weeks to days. Further, specialized hardware and algorithm optimizations can be used for efficient processing of deep learning models.\\n\\n\\n=== Deep learning revolution ===\\n\\nIn the late 2000s, deep learning started to outperform other methods in machine learning competitions.\\nIn 2009, a long short-term memory trained by connectionist temporal classification (Alex Graves, Santiago Fernández, Faustino Gomez, and Jürgen Schmidhuber, 2006) was the first RNN to win pattern recognition contests, winning three competitions in connected handwriting recognition. Google later used CTC-trained LSTM for speech recognition on the smartphone.\\nSignificant impacts in image or object recognition were felt from 2011 to 2012. Although CNNs trained by backpropagation had been around for decades, and GPU implementations of NNs for years, including CNNs, faster implementations of CNNs on GPUs were needed to progress on computer vision. In 2011, the DanNet by Dan Ciresan, Ueli Meier, Jonathan Masci, Luca Maria Gambardella, and Jürgen Schmidhuber achieved for the first time superhuman performance in a visual pattern recognition contest, outperforming traditional methods by a factor of 3. Also in 2011, DanNet won the ICDAR Chinese handwriting contest, and in May 2012, it won the ISBI image segmentation contest. Until 2011, CNNs did not play a major role at computer vision conferences, but in June 2012, a paper by Ciresan et al. at the leading conference CVPR showed how max-pooling CNNs on GPU can dramatically improve many vision benchmark records.  In September 2012, DanNet also won the ICPR contest on analysis of large medical images for cancer detection, and in the following year also the MICCAI Grand Challenge on the same topic. In October 2012, the similar AlexNet by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton won the large-scale ImageNet competition by a significant margin over shallow machine learning methods. \\nThe VGG-16 network by Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zisserman further reduced the error rate and\\nwon the ImageNet 2014 competition, following a similar trend in large-scale speech recognition.\\nImage classification was then extended to the more challenging task of generating descriptions (captions) for images, often as a combination of CNNs and LSTMs.\\nIn 2012, a team led by George E. Dahl won the \"Merck Molecular Activity Challenge\" using multi-task deep neural networks to predict the biomolecular target of one drug. In 2014, Sepp Hochreiter\\'s group used deep learning to detect off-target and toxic effects of environmental chemicals in nutrients, household products and drugs and won the \"Tox21 Data Challenge\" of NIH, FDA and NCATS.\\nIn 2016, Roger Parloff mentioned a \"deep learning revolution\" that has transformed the AI industry.\\nIn March 2019, Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun were awarded the Turing Award for conceptual and engineering breakthroughs that have made deep neural networks a critical component of computing.\\n\\n\\n== Neural networks ==\\n\\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs) or connectionist systems are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems learn (progressively improve their ability) to do tasks by considering examples, generally without task-specific programming. For example, in image recognition, they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as \"cat\" or \"no cat\" and using the analytic results to identify cats in other images. They have found most use in applications difficult to express with a traditional computer algorithm using rule-based programming.\\nAn ANN is based on a collection of connected units called artificial neurons, (analogous to biological neurons in a biological brain). Each connection (synapse) between neurons can transmit a signal to another neuron. The receiving (postsynaptic) neuron can process the signal(s) and then signal downstream neurons connected to it. Neurons may have state, generally represented by real numbers, typically between 0 and 1. Neurons and synapses may also have a weight that varies as learning proceeds, which can increase or decrease the strength of the signal that it sends downstream.\\nTypically, neurons are organized in layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first (input), to the last (output) layer, possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.\\nThe original goal of the neural network approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. Over time, attention focused on matching specific mental abilities, leading to deviations from biology such as backpropagation, or passing information in the reverse direction and adjusting the network to reflect that information.\\nNeural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis.\\nAs of 2017, neural networks typically have a few thousand to a few million units and millions of connections. Despite this number being several order of magnitude less than the number of neurons on a human brain, these networks can perform many tasks at a level beyond that of humans (e.g., recognizing faces, or playing \"Go\").\\n\\n\\n=== Deep neural networks ===\\nA deep neural network (DNN) is an artificial neural network with multiple layers between the input and output layers. There are different types of neural networks but they always consist of the same components: neurons, synapses, weights, biases, and functions. These components as a whole function in a way that mimics functions of the human brain, and can be trained like any other ML algorithm.\\nFor example, a DNN that is trained to recognize dog breeds will go over the given image and calculate the probability that the dog in the image is a certain breed. The user can review the results and select which probabilities the network should display (above a certain threshold, etc.) and return the proposed label. Each mathematical manipulation as such is considered a layer, and complex DNN have many layers, hence the name \"deep\" networks.\\nDNNs can model complex non-linear relationships. DNN architectures generate compositional models where the object is expressed as a layered composition of primitives. The extra layers enable composition of features from lower layers, potentially modeling complex data with fewer units than a similarly performing shallow network. For instance, it was proved that sparse multivariate polynomials are exponentially easier to approximate with DNNs than with shallow networks.\\nDeep architectures include many variants of a few basic approaches. Each architecture has found success in specific domains. It is not always possible to compare the performance of multiple architectures, unless they have been evaluated on the same data sets.\\nDNNs are typically feedforward networks in which data flows from the input layer to the output layer without looping back. At first, the DNN creates a map of virtual neurons and assigns random numerical values, or \"weights\", to connections between them. The weights and inputs are multiplied and return an output between 0 and 1. If the network did not accurately recognize a particular pattern, an algorithm would adjust the weights. That way the algorithm can make certain parameters more influential, until it determines the correct mathematical manipulation to fully process the data.\\nRecurrent neural networks, in which data can flow in any direction, are used for applications such as language modeling. Long short-term memory is particularly effective for this use.\\nConvolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used in computer vision. CNNs also have been applied to acoustic modeling for automatic speech recognition (ASR).\\n\\n\\n==== Challenges ====\\nAs with ANNs, many issues can arise with naively trained DNNs. Two common issues are overfitting and computation time.\\nDNNs are prone to overfitting because of the added layers of abstraction, which allow them to model rare dependencies in the training data. Regularization methods such as Ivakhnenko\\'s unit pruning or weight decay (\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          ℓ\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\ell _{2}}\\n  \\n-regularization) or sparsity (\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          ℓ\\n          \\n            1\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\ell _{1}}\\n  \\n-regularization) can be applied during training to combat overfitting. Alternatively dropout regularization randomly omits units from the hidden layers during training. This helps to exclude rare dependencies. Finally, data can be augmented via methods such as cropping and rotating such that smaller training sets can be increased in size to reduce the chances of overfitting.\\nDNNs must consider many training parameters, such as the size (number of layers and number of units per layer), the learning rate, and initial weights. Sweeping through the parameter space for optimal parameters may not be feasible due to the cost in time and computational resources. Various tricks, such as batching (computing the gradient on several training examples at once rather than individual examples) speed up computation. Large processing capabilities of many-core architectures (such as GPUs or the Intel Xeon Phi) have produced significant speedups in training, because of the suitability of such processing architectures for the matrix and vector computations.\\nAlternatively, engineers may look for other types of neural networks with more straightforward and convergent training algorithms. CMAC (cerebellar model articulation controller) is one such kind of neural network. It doesn\\'t require learning rates or randomized initial weights. The training process can be guaranteed to converge in one step with a new batch of data, and the computational complexity of the training algorithm is linear with respect to the number of neurons involved.\\n\\n\\n== Hardware ==\\nSince the 2010s, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks that contain many layers of non-linear hidden units and a very large output layer. By 2019, graphic processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method of training large-scale commercial cloud AI. OpenAI estimated the hardware computation used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet (2012) to AlphaZero (2017), and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of computation required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months.\\nSpecial electronic circuits called deep learning processors were designed to speed up deep learning algorithms. Deep learning processors include neural processing units (NPUs) in Huawei cellphones and cloud computing servers such as tensor processing units (TPU) in the Google Cloud Platform. Cerebras Systems has also built a dedicated system to handle large deep learning models, the CS-2, based on the largest processor in the industry, the second-generation Wafer Scale Engine (WSE-2).\\nAtomically thin semiconductors are considered promising for energy-efficient deep learning hardware where the same basic device structure is used for both logic operations and data storage.\\nIn 2020, Marega et al. published experiments with a large-area active channel material for developing logic-in-memory devices and circuits based on floating-gate field-effect transistors (FGFETs).\\nIn 2021, J. Feldmann et al. proposed an integrated photonic hardware accelerator for parallel convolutional processing. The authors identify two key advantages of integrated photonics over its electronic counterparts: (1) massively parallel data transfer through wavelength division multiplexing in conjunction with frequency combs, and (2) extremely high data modulation speeds. Their system can execute trillions of multiply-accumulate operations per second, indicating the potential of integrated photonics in data-heavy AI applications.\\n\\n\\n== Applications ==\\n\\n\\n=== Automatic speech recognition ===\\n\\nLarge-scale automatic speech recognition is the first and most convincing successful case of deep learning. LSTM RNNs can learn \"Very Deep Learning\" tasks that involve multi-second intervals containing speech events separated by thousands of discrete time steps, where one time step corresponds to about 10 ms. LSTM with forget gates is competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks.\\nThe initial success in speech recognition was based on small-scale recognition tasks based on TIMIT. The data set contains 630 speakers from eight major dialects of American English, where each speaker reads 10 sentences. Its small size lets many configurations be tried. More importantly, the TIMIT task concerns phone-sequence recognition, which, unlike word-sequence recognition, allows weak phone bigram language models. This lets the strength of the acoustic modeling aspects of speech recognition be more easily analyzed. The error rates listed below, including these early results and measured as percent phone error rates (PER), have been summarized since 1991.\\n\\nThe debut of DNNs for speaker recognition in the late 1990s and speech recognition around 2009-2011 and of LSTM around 2003–2007, accelerated progress in eight major areas:\\n\\nScale-up/out and accelerated DNN training and decoding\\nSequence discriminative training\\nFeature processing by deep models with solid understanding of the underlying mechanisms\\nAdaptation of DNNs and related deep models\\nMulti-task and transfer learning by DNNs and related deep models\\nCNNs and how to design them to best exploit domain knowledge of speech\\nRNN and its rich LSTM variants\\nOther types of deep models including tensor-based models and integrated deep generative/discriminative models.\\nAll major commercial speech recognition systems (e.g., Microsoft Cortana, Xbox, Skype Translator, Amazon Alexa, Google Now, Apple Siri, Baidu and iFlyTek voice search, and a range of Nuance speech products, etc.) are based on deep learning.\\n\\n\\n=== Image recognition ===\\n\\nA common evaluation set for image classification is the MNIST database data set. MNIST is composed of handwritten digits and includes 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples. As with TIMIT, its small size lets users test multiple configurations. A comprehensive list of results on this set is available.\\nDeep learning-based image recognition has become \"superhuman\", producing more accurate results than human contestants. This first occurred in 2011 in recognition of traffic signs, and in 2014, with recognition of human faces.\\nDeep learning-trained vehicles now interpret 360° camera views. Another example is Facial Dysmorphology Novel Analysis (FDNA) used to analyze cases of human malformation connected to a large database of genetic syndromes.\\n\\n\\n=== Visual art processing ===\\n\\nClosely related to the progress that has been made in image recognition is the increasing application of deep learning techniques to various visual art tasks. DNNs have proven themselves capable, for example, of\\n\\nidentifying the style period of a given painting\\nNeural Style Transfer –  capturing the style of a given artwork and applying it in a visually pleasing manner to an arbitrary photograph or video\\ngenerating striking imagery based on random visual input fields.\\n\\n\\n=== Natural language processing ===\\n\\nNeural networks have been used for implementing language models since the early 2000s. LSTM helped to improve machine translation and language modeling.\\nOther key techniques in this field are negative sampling and word embedding. Word embedding, such as word2vec, can be thought of as a representational layer in a deep learning architecture that transforms an atomic word into a positional representation of the word relative to other words in the dataset; the position is represented as a point in a vector space. Using word embedding as an RNN input layer allows the network to parse sentences and phrases using an effective compositional vector grammar. A compositional vector grammar can be thought of as probabilistic context free grammar (PCFG) implemented by an RNN. Recursive auto-encoders built atop word embeddings can assess sentence similarity and detect paraphrasing. Deep neural architectures provide the best results for constituency parsing, sentiment analysis, information retrieval, spoken language understanding, machine translation, contextual entity linking, writing style recognition, named-entity recognition (token classification), text classification, and others.\\nRecent developments generalize word embedding to sentence embedding.\\nGoogle Translate (GT) uses a large end-to-end long short-term memory (LSTM) network. Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT) uses an example-based machine translation method in which the system \"learns from millions of examples\". It translates \"whole sentences at a time, rather than pieces\". Google Translate supports over one hundred languages. The network encodes the \"semantics of the sentence rather than simply memorizing phrase-to-phrase translations\". GT uses English as an intermediate between most language pairs.\\n\\n\\n=== Drug discovery and toxicology ===\\n\\nA large percentage of candidate drugs fail to win regulatory approval. These failures are caused by insufficient efficacy (on-target effect), undesired interactions (off-target effects), or unanticipated toxic effects. Research has explored use of deep learning to predict the biomolecular targets, off-targets, and toxic effects of environmental chemicals in nutrients, household products and drugs.\\nAtomNet is a deep learning system for structure-based rational drug design. AtomNet was used to predict novel candidate biomolecules for disease targets such as the Ebola virus and multiple sclerosis.\\nIn 2017 graph neural networks were used for the first time to predict various properties of molecules in a large toxicology data set. In 2019, generative neural networks were used to produce molecules that were validated experimentally all the way into mice.\\n\\n\\n=== Customer relationship management ===\\n\\nDeep reinforcement learning has been used to approximate the value of possible direct marketing actions, defined in terms of RFM variables. The estimated value function was shown to have a natural interpretation as customer lifetime value.\\n\\n\\n=== Recommendation systems ===\\n\\nRecommendation systems have used deep learning to extract meaningful features for a latent factor model for content-based music and journal recommendations. Multi-view deep learning has been applied for learning user preferences from multiple domains. The model uses a hybrid collaborative and content-based approach and enhances recommendations in multiple tasks.\\n\\n\\n=== Bioinformatics ===\\n\\nAn autoencoder ANN was used in bioinformatics, to predict gene ontology annotations and gene-function relationships.\\nIn medical informatics, deep learning was used to predict sleep quality based on data from wearables and predictions of health complications from electronic health record data.\\n\\n\\n=== Deep Neural Network Estimations ===\\nDeep neural networks can be used to estimate the entropy of a stochastic process and called Neural Joint Entropy Estimator (NJEE). Such an estimation provides insights on the effects of input random variables on an independent random variable. Practically, the DNN is trained as a classifier that maps an input vector or matrix X to an output probability distribution over the possible classes of random variable Y, given input X. For example, in image classification tasks, the NJEE maps a vector of pixels\\' color values to probabilities over possible image classes. In practice, the probability distribution of Y is obtained by a Softmax layer with number of nodes that is equal to the alphabet size of Y. NJEE uses continuously differentiable activation functions, such that the conditions for the universal approximation theorem holds. It is shown that this method provides a strongly consistent estimator and outperforms other methods in case of large alphabet sizes.\\n\\n\\n=== Medical image analysis ===\\nDeep learning has been shown to produce competitive results in medical application such as cancer cell classification, lesion detection, organ segmentation and image enhancement. Modern deep learning tools demonstrate the high accuracy of detecting various diseases and the helpfulness of their use by specialists to improve the diagnosis efficiency.\\n\\n\\n=== Mobile advertising ===\\nFinding the appropriate mobile audience for mobile advertising is always challenging, since many data points must be considered and analyzed before a target segment can be created and used in ad serving by any ad server. Deep learning has been used to interpret large, many-dimensioned advertising datasets. Many data points are collected during the request/serve/click internet advertising cycle. This information can form the basis of machine learning to improve ad selection.\\n\\n\\n=== Image restoration ===\\nDeep learning has been successfully applied to inverse problems such as denoising, super-resolution, inpainting, and film colorization. These applications include learning methods such as \"Shrinkage Fields for Effective Image Restoration\" which trains on an image dataset, and Deep Image Prior, which trains on the image that needs restoration.\\n\\n\\n=== Financial fraud detection ===\\nDeep learning is being successfully applied to financial fraud detection, tax evasion detection, and anti-money laundering.\\n\\n\\n=== Materials science ===\\nIn November 2023, researchers at Google DeepMind and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory announced that they had developed an AI system known as GNoME. This system has contributed to materials science by discovering over 2 million new materials within a relatively short timeframe. GNoME employs deep learning techniques to efficiently explore potential material structures, achieving a significant increase in the identification of stable inorganic crystal structures. The system\\'s predictions were validated through autonomous robotic experiments, demonstrating a noteworthy success rate of 71%. The data of newly discovered materials is publicly available through the Materials Project database, offering researchers the opportunity to identify materials with desired properties for various applications. This development has implications for the future of scientific discovery and the integration of AI in material science research, potentially expediting material innovation and reducing costs in product development. The use of AI and deep learning suggests the possibility of minimizing or eliminating manual lab experiments and allowing scientists to focus more on the design and analysis of unique compounds.\\n\\n\\n=== Military ===\\nThe United States Department of Defense applied deep learning to train robots in new tasks through observation.\\n\\n\\n=== Partial differential equations ===\\nPhysics informed neural networks have been used to solve partial differential equations in both forward and inverse problems in a data driven manner. One example is the reconstructing fluid flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. Using physics informed neural networks does not require the often expensive mesh generation that conventional CFD methods relies on.\\n\\n\\n=== Image reconstruction ===\\nImage reconstruction is the reconstruction of the underlying images from the image-related measurements. Several works showed the better and superior performance of the deep learning methods compared to analytical methods for various applications, e.g., spectral imaging  and ultrasound imaging.\\n\\n\\n=== Epigenetic clock ===\\n\\nAn epigenetic clock is a biochemical test that can be used to measure age. Galkin et al. used deep neural networks to train an epigenetic aging clock of unprecedented accuracy using >6,000 blood samples. The clock uses information from 1000 CpG sites and predicts people with certain conditions older than healthy controls: IBD, frontotemporal dementia, ovarian cancer, obesity. The aging clock was planned to be released for public use in 2021 by an Insilico Medicine spinoff company Deep Longevity.\\n\\n\\n== Relation to human cognitive and brain development ==\\nDeep learning is closely related to a class of theories of brain development (specifically, neocortical development) proposed by cognitive neuroscientists in the early 1990s. These developmental theories were instantiated in computational models, making them predecessors of deep learning systems. These developmental models share the property that various proposed learning dynamics in the brain (e.g., a wave of nerve growth factor) support the self-organization somewhat analogous to the neural networks utilized in deep learning models. Like the neocortex, neural networks employ a hierarchy of layered filters in which each layer considers information from a prior layer (or the operating environment), and then passes its output (and possibly the original input), to other layers. This process yields a self-organizing stack of transducers, well-tuned to their operating environment. A 1995 description stated, \"...the infant\\'s brain seems to organize itself under the influence of waves of so-called trophic-factors ... different regions of the brain become connected sequentially, with one layer of tissue maturing before another and so on until the whole brain is mature\".\\nA variety of approaches have been used to investigate the plausibility of deep learning models from a neurobiological perspective. On the one hand, several variants of the backpropagation algorithm have been proposed in order to increase its processing realism. Other researchers have argued that unsupervised forms of deep learning, such as those based on hierarchical generative models and deep belief networks, may be closer to biological reality. In this respect, generative neural network models have been related to neurobiological evidence about sampling-based processing in the cerebral cortex.\\nAlthough a systematic comparison between the human brain organization and the neuronal encoding in deep networks has not yet been established, several analogies have been reported. For example, the computations performed by deep learning units could be similar to those of actual neurons and neural populations. Similarly, the representations developed by deep learning models are similar to those measured in the primate visual system both at the single-unit and at the population levels.\\n\\n\\n== Commercial activity ==\\nFacebook\\'s AI lab performs tasks such as automatically tagging uploaded pictures with the names of the people in them.\\nGoogle\\'s DeepMind Technologies developed a system capable of learning how to play Atari video games using only pixels as data input. In 2015 they demonstrated their AlphaGo system, which learned the game of Go well enough to beat a professional Go player. Google Translate uses a neural network to translate between more than 100 languages.\\nIn 2017, Covariant.ai was launched, which focuses on integrating deep learning into factories.\\nAs of 2008, researchers at The University of Texas at Austin (UT) developed a machine learning framework called Training an Agent Manually via Evaluative Reinforcement, or TAMER, which proposed new methods for robots or computer programs to learn how to perform tasks by interacting with a human instructor. First developed as TAMER, a new algorithm called Deep TAMER was later introduced in 2018 during a collaboration between U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) and UT researchers. Deep TAMER used deep learning to provide a robot with the ability to learn new tasks through observation. Using Deep TAMER, a robot learned a task with a human trainer, watching video streams or observing a human perform a task in-person. The robot later practiced the task with the help of some coaching from the trainer, who provided feedback such as \"good job\" and \"bad job\".\\n\\n\\n== Criticism and comment ==\\nDeep learning has attracted both criticism and comment, in some cases from outside the field of computer science.\\n\\n\\n=== Theory ===\\n\\nA main criticism concerns the lack of theory surrounding some methods. Learning in the most common deep architectures is implemented using well-understood gradient descent. However, the theory surrounding other algorithms, such as contrastive divergence is less clear. (e.g., Does it converge? If so, how fast? What is it approximating?) Deep learning methods are often looked at as a black box, with most confirmations done empirically, rather than theoretically.\\nOthers point out that deep learning should be looked at as a step towards realizing strong AI, not as an all-encompassing solution. Despite the power of deep learning methods, they still lack much of the functionality needed to realize this goal entirely. Research psychologist Gary Marcus noted:\\n\\nRealistically, deep learning is only part of the larger challenge of building intelligent machines. Such techniques lack ways of representing causal relationships (...) have no obvious ways of performing logical inferences, and they are also still a long way from integrating abstract knowledge, such as information about what objects are, what they are for, and how they are typically used. The most powerful A.I. systems, like Watson (...) use techniques like deep learning as just one element in a very complicated ensemble of techniques, ranging from the statistical technique of Bayesian inference to deductive reasoning.\\n\\nIn further reference to the idea that artistic sensitivity might be inherent in relatively low levels of the cognitive hierarchy, a published series of graphic representations of the internal states of deep (20-30 layers) neural networks attempting to discern within essentially random data the images on which they were trained demonstrate a visual appeal: the original research notice received well over 1,000 comments, and was the subject of what was for a time the most frequently accessed article on The Guardian\\'s website.\\n\\n\\n=== Errors ===\\nSome deep learning architectures display problematic behaviors, such as confidently classifying unrecognizable images as belonging to a familiar category of ordinary images (2014) and misclassifying minuscule perturbations of correctly classified images (2013). Goertzel hypothesized that these behaviors are due to limitations in their internal representations and that these limitations would inhibit integration into heterogeneous multi-component artificial general intelligence (AGI) architectures. These issues may possibly be addressed by deep learning architectures that internally form states homologous to image-grammar decompositions of observed entities and events. Learning a grammar (visual or linguistic) from training data would be equivalent to restricting the system to commonsense reasoning that operates on concepts in terms of grammatical production rules and is a basic goal of both human language acquisition and artificial intelligence (AI).\\n\\n\\n=== Cyber threat ===\\nAs deep learning moves from the lab into the world, research and experience show that artificial neural networks are vulnerable to hacks and deception. By identifying patterns that these systems use to function, attackers can modify inputs to ANNs in such a way that the ANN finds a match that human observers would not recognize. For example, an attacker can make subtle changes to an image such that the ANN finds a match even though the image looks to a human nothing like the search target. Such manipulation is termed an \"adversarial attack\".\\nIn 2016 researchers used one ANN to doctor images in trial and error fashion, identify another\\'s focal points, and thereby generate images that deceived it. The modified images looked no different to human eyes. Another group showed that printouts of doctored images then photographed successfully tricked an image classification system. One defense is reverse image search, in which a possible fake image is submitted to a site such as TinEye that can then find other instances of it. A refinement is to search using only parts of the image, to identify images from which that piece may have been taken.\\nAnother group showed that certain psychedelic spectacles could fool a facial recognition system into thinking ordinary people were celebrities, potentially allowing one person to impersonate another. In 2017 researchers added stickers to stop signs and caused an ANN to misclassify them.\\nANNs can however be further trained to detect attempts at deception, potentially leading attackers and defenders into an arms race similar to the kind that already defines the malware defense industry. ANNs have been trained to defeat ANN-based anti-malware software by repeatedly attacking a defense with malware that was continually altered by a genetic algorithm until it tricked the anti-malware while retaining its ability to damage the target.\\nIn 2016, another group demonstrated that certain sounds could make the Google Now voice command system open a particular web address, and hypothesized that this could \"serve as a stepping stone for further attacks (e.g., opening a web page hosting drive-by malware)\".\\nIn \"data poisoning\", false data is continually smuggled into a machine learning system\\'s training set to prevent it from achieving mastery.\\n\\n\\n=== Data collection ethics ===\\n\\nMost Deep Learning systems rely on training and verification data that is generated and/or annotated by humans. It has been argued in media philosophy that not only low-paid clickwork (e.g. on Amazon Mechanical Turk) is regularly deployed for this purpose, but also implicit forms of human microwork that are often not recognized as such. The philosopher Rainer Mühlhoff distinguishes five types of \"machinic capture\" of human microwork to generate training data: (1) gamification (the embedding of annotation or computation tasks in the flow of a game), (2) \"trapping and tracking\" (e.g. CAPTCHAs for image recognition or click-tracking on Google search results pages), (3) exploitation of social motivations (e.g. tagging faces on Facebook to obtain labeled facial images), (4) information mining (e.g. by leveraging quantified-self devices such as activity trackers) and (5) clickwork.\\nMühlhoff argues that in most commercial end-user applications of Deep Learning such as Facebook\\'s face recognition system, the need for training data does not stop once an ANN is trained. Rather, there is a continued demand for human-generated verification data to constantly calibrate and update the ANN. For this purpose, Facebook introduced the feature that once a user is automatically recognized in an image, they receive a notification. They can choose whether or not they like to be publicly labeled on the image, or tell Facebook that it is not them in the picture. This user interface is a mechanism to generate \"a constant stream of verification data\" to further train the network in real-time. As Mühlhoff argues, the involvement of human users to generate training and verification data is so typical for most commercial end-user applications of Deep Learning that such systems may be referred to as \"human-aided artificial intelligence\".\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nApplications of artificial intelligence\\nComparison of deep learning software\\nCompressed sensing\\nDifferentiable programming\\nEcho state network\\nList of artificial intelligence projects\\nLiquid state machine\\nList of datasets for machine-learning research\\nReservoir computing\\nScale space and deep learning\\nSparse coding\\nStochastic parrot\\nTopological deep learning\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==Title: Artificial intelligence\\n\\nArtificial intelligence (AI), in its broadest sense, is intelligence exhibited by machines, particularly computer systems. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and uses learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. Such machines may be called AIs.\\nAI technology is widely used throughout industry, government, and science. Some high-profile applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); interacting via human speech (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it\\'s not labeled AI anymore.\"\\nAlan Turing was the first person to conduct substantial research in the field that he called machine intelligence. Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956. The field went through multiple cycles of optimism, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winter. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning surpassed all previous AI techniques, and after 2017 with the transformer architecture. This led to the AI boom of the early 2020s, with companies, universities, and laboratories overwhelmingly based in the United States pioneering significant advances in artificial intelligence.\\nThe growing use of artificial intelligence in the 21st century is influencing a societal and economic shift towards increased automation, data-driven decision-making, and the integration of AI systems into various economic sectors and areas of life, impacting job markets, healthcare, government, industry, and education. This raises questions about the long-term effects, ethical implications, and risks of AI, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology. \\nThe various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence—the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level—is among the field\\'s long-term goals.\\nTo reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.\\n\\n\\n== Goals ==\\nThe general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.\\n\\n\\n=== Reasoning and problem-solving ===\\nEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions. By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.\\nMany of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow. Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments. Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.\\n\\n\\n=== Knowledge representation ===\\n\\nKnowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval, scene interpretation, clinical decision support, knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases), and other areas.\\nA knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge. Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects; situations, events, states, and time; causes and effects; knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know); default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing); and many other aspects and domains of knowledge.\\nAmong the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous); and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally). There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition, the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications.\\n\\n\\n=== Planning and decision-making ===\\nAn \"agent\" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen. In automated planning, the agent has a specific goal. In automated decision-making, the agent has preferences—there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \"utility\") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the \"expected utility\": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility.\\nIn classical planning, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be. In most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is \"unknown\" or \"unobservable\") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not \"deterministic\"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked.\\nIn some problems, the agent\\'s preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning), or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences. Information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions. The space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be.\\nA Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A policy associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g., by iteration), be heuristic, or it can be learned.\\nGame theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents.\\n\\n\\n=== Learning ===\\nMachine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically. It has been a part of AI from the beginning.\\nThere are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance. Supervised learning requires a human to label the input data first, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input).\\nIn reinforcement learning, the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as \"good\". Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem. Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning.\\nComputational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization.\\n\\n\\n=== Natural language processing ===\\nNatural language processing (NLP) allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages such as English. Specific problems include speech recognition, speech synthesis, machine translation, information extraction, information retrieval and question answering.\\nEarly work, based on Noam Chomsky\\'s generative grammar and semantic networks, had difficulty with word-sense disambiguation unless restricted to small domains called \"micro-worlds\" (due to the common sense knowledge problem). Margaret Masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure.\\nModern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding (representing words, typically as vectors encoding their meaning), transformers (a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism), and others. In 2019, generative pre-trained transformer (or \"GPT\") language models began to generate coherent text, and by 2023 these models were able to get human-level scores on the bar exam, SAT test, GRE test, and many other real-world applications.\\n\\n\\n=== Perception ===\\nMachine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world. Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input.\\nThe field includes speech recognition, image classification, facial recognition, object recognition, and robotic perception.\\n\\n\\n=== Social intelligence ===\\n\\nAffective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human feeling, emotion, and mood. For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction.\\nHowever, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents. Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis, wherein AI classifies the affects displayed by a videotaped subject.\\n\\n\\n=== General intelligence ===\\nA machine with artificial general intelligence should be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence.\\n\\n\\n== Techniques ==\\nAI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above.\\n\\n\\n=== Search and optimization ===\\nAI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions. There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search.\\n\\n\\n==== State space search ====\\nState space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state. For example, planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis.\\nSimple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is too slow or never completes. \"Heuristics\" or \"rules of thumb\" can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal.\\nAdversarial search is used for game-playing programs, such as chess or Go. It searches through a tree of possible moves and counter-moves, looking for a winning position.\\n\\n\\n==== Local search ====\\nLocal search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem. It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally.\\nGradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function. Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks.\\nAnother type of local search is evolutionary computation, which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by \"mutating\" and \"recombining\" them, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation.\\nDistributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails).\\n\\n\\n=== Logic ===\\nFormal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation.\\nFormal logic comes in two main forms: propositional logic (which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as \"and\", \"or\", \"not\" and \"implies\") and predicate logic (which also operates on objects, predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as \"Every X is a Y\" and \"There are some Xs that are Ys\").\\nDeductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement (conclusion) from other statements that are given and assumed to be true (the premises). Proofs can be structured as proof trees, in which nodes are labelled by sentences, and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules.\\nGiven a problem and a set of premises, problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms. In the case of Horn clauses, problem-solving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem. In the more general case of the clausal form of first-order logic, resolution is a single, axiom-free rule of inference, in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved.\\nInference in both Horn clause logic and first-order logic is undecidable, and therefore intractable. However, backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which underpins computation in the logic programming language Prolog, is Turing complete. Moreover, its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages.\\nFuzzy logic assigns a \"degree of truth\" between 0 and 1. It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true.\\nNon-monotonic logics, including logic programming with negation as failure, are designed to handle default reasoning.\\nOther specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains.\\n\\n\\n=== Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning ===\\n\\nMany problems in AI (including in reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics. Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis, and information value theory. These tools include models such as Markov decision processes, dynamic decision networks, game theory and mechanism design.\\nBayesian networks are a tool that can be used for reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm), learning (using the expectation-maximization algorithm), planning (using decision networks) and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks).\\n\\nProbabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing, and finding explanations for streams of data, thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters).\\n\\n\\n=== Classifiers and statistical learning methods ===\\nThe simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g., \"if shiny then diamond\"), on one hand, and controllers (e.g., \"if diamond then pick up\"), on the other hand. Classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match. They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning. Each pattern (also called an \"observation\") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.\\nThere are many kinds of classifiers in use. The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm. K-nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, and Kernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s.\\nThe naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the \"most widely used learner\" at Google, due in part to its scalability.\\nNeural networks are also used as classifiers.\\n\\n\\n=== Artificial neural networks ===\\n\\nAn artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. It is trained to recognise patterns; once trained, it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. There is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output. Each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer. A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers.\\nLearning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm.\\nNeural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function.\\nIn feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction. Recurrent neural networks feed the output signal back into the input, which allows short-term memories of previous input events. Long short term memory is the most successful network architecture for recurrent networks.\\nPerceptrons\\nuse only a single layer of neurons, deep learning uses multiple layers.\\nConvolutional neural networks strengthen the connection between neurons that are \"close\" to each other—this is especially important in image processing, where a local set of neurons must identify an \"edge\" before the network can identify an object.\\n\\n\\n=== Deep learning ===\\n\\nDeep learning\\nuses several layers of neurons between the network\\'s inputs and outputs. The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits, letters, or faces.\\nDeep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, image classification, and others. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2023.\\nThe sudden success of deep learning in 2012–2015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s)\\nbut because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching to GPUs) and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing, such as ImageNet.\\n\\n\\n=== GPT ===\\nGenerative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are large language models that are based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences (natural language processing). Text-based GPT models are pre-trained on a large corpus of text which can be from the internet. The pre-training consists in predicting the next token (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). Throughout this pre-training, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world, and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token. Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful and harmless, usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Current GPT models are still prone to generating falsehoods called \"hallucinations\", although this can be reduced with RLHF and quality data. They are used in chatbots, which allow you to ask a question or request a task in simple text.\\nCurrent models and services include: Gemini (formerly Bard), ChatGPT, Grok, Claude, Copilot and LLaMA. Multimodal GPT models can process different types of data (modalities) such as images, videos, sound, and text.\\n\\n\\n=== Specialized hardware and software ===\\n\\nIn the late 2010s, graphics processing units (GPUs) that were increasingly designed with AI-specific enhancements and used with specialized TensorFlow software had replaced previously used central processing unit (CPUs) as the dominant means for large-scale (commercial and academic) machine learning models\\' training. Historically, specialized languages, such as Lisp, Prolog, Python and others, had been used.\\n\\n\\n== Applications ==\\nAI and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s, including: search engines (such as Google Search), targeting online advertisements, recommendation systems (offered by Netflix, YouTube or Amazon), driving internet traffic, targeted advertising (AdSense, Facebook), virtual assistants (such as Siri or Alexa), autonomous vehicles (including drones, ADAS and self-driving cars), automatic language translation (Microsoft Translator, Google Translate), facial recognition (Apple\\'s Face ID or Microsoft\\'s DeepFace and Google\\'s FaceNet) and image labeling (used by Facebook, Apple\\'s iPhoto and TikTok).\\n\\n\\n=== Health and medicine ===\\n\\nThe application of AI in medicine and medical research has the potential to increase patient care and quality of life. Through the lens of the Hippocratic Oath, medical professionals are ethically compelled to use AI, if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients.\\nFor medical research, AI is an important tool for processing and integrating big data. This is particularly important for organoid and tissue engineering development which use microscopy imaging as a key technique in fabrication. It has been suggested that AI can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research. New AI tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant pathways. For example, AlphaFold 2 (2021) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a protein. In 2023, it was reported that AI-guided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drug-resistant bacteria. In 2024, researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for Parkinson\\'s disease drug treatments. Their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping, or aggregation, of alpha-synuclein (the protein that characterises Parkinson\\'s disease). They were able to speed up the initial screening process ten-fold and reduce the cost by a thousand-fold.\\n\\n\\n=== Games ===\\n\\nGame playing programs have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test AI\\'s most advanced techniques. Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997. In 2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM\\'s question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin. In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol, becoming the first computer Go-playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps. Then in 2017 it defeated Ke Jie, who was the best Go player in the world. Other programs handle imperfect-information games, such as the poker-playing program Pluribus. DeepMind developed increasingly generalistic reinforcement learning models, such as with MuZero, which could be trained to play chess, Go, or Atari games. In 2019, DeepMind\\'s AlphaStar achieved grandmaster level in StarCraft II, a particularly challenging real-time strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map. In 2021, an AI agent competed in a PlayStation Gran Turismo competition, winning against four of the world\\'s best Gran Turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning.\\n\\n\\n=== Military ===\\n\\nVarious countries are deploying AI military applications. The main applications enhance command and control, communications, sensors, integration and interoperability. Research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles. AI technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions, target acquisition, coordination and deconfliction of distributed Joint Fires between networked combat vehicles involving manned and unmanned teams. AI was incorporated into military operations in Iraq and Syria.\\nIn November 2023, US Vice President Kamala Harris disclosed a declaration signed by 31 nations to set guardrails for the military use of AI. The commitments include using legal reviews to ensure the compliance of military AI with international laws, and being cautious and transparent in the development of this technology.\\n\\n\\n=== Generative AI ===\\n\\nIn the early 2020s, generative AI gained widespread prominence. In March 2023, 58% of U.S. adults had heard about ChatGPT and 14% had tried it. The increasing realism and ease-of-use of AI-based text-to-image generators such as Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion sparked a trend of viral AI-generated photos. Widespread attention was gained by a fake photo of Pope Francis wearing a white puffer coat, the fictional arrest of Donald Trump, and a hoax of an attack on the Pentagon, as well as the usage in professional creative arts.\\n\\n\\n=== Industry-specific tasks ===\\nThere are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions. In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported having incorporated \"AI\" in some offerings or processes. A few examples are energy storage, medical diagnosis, military logistics, applications that predict the result of judicial decisions, foreign policy, or supply chain management.\\nIn agriculture, AI has helped farmers identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments or increasing yield. Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development. AI has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes, monitor soil moisture, operate agricultural robots, conduct predictive analytics, classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and save water.\\nArtificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications, mainly for \"classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights\" for example for discovering exoplanets, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy. It could also be used for activities in space such as space exploration, including analysis of data from space missions, real-time science decisions of spacecraft, space debris avoidance, and more autonomous operation.\\n\\n\\n== Ethics ==\\n\\nAI has potential benefits and potential risks. AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems: Demis Hassabis of Deep Mind hopes to \"solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else\". However, as the use of AI has become widespread, several unintended consequences and risks have been identified. In-production systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their AI training processes, especially when the AI algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning.\\n\\n\\n=== Risks and harm ===\\n\\n\\n==== Privacy and copyright ====\\n\\nMachine-learning algorithms require large amounts of data. The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy, surveillance and copyright.\\nTechnology companies collect a wide range of data from their users, including online activity, geolocation data, video and audio.\\nFor example, in order to build speech recognition algorithms, Amazon has recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temporary workers to listen to and transcribe some of them. Opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy.\\nAI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications. and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data, such as data aggregation, de-identification and differential privacy. Since 2016, some privacy experts, such as Cynthia Dwork, have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness. Brian Christian wrote that experts have pivoted \"from the question of \\'what they know\\' to the question of \\'what they\\'re doing with it\\'.\"\\nGenerative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or computer code; the output is then used under the rationale of \"fair use\". Experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include \"the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work\" and \"the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work\". Website owners who do not wish to have their content scraped can indicate it in a \"robots.txt\" file. In 2023, leading authors (including John Grisham and Jonathan Franzen) sued AI companies for using their work to train generative AI. Another discussed approach is to envision a separate sui generis system of protection for creations generated by AI to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors.\\n\\n\\n==== Misinformation ====\\n\\nYouTube, Facebook and others use recommender systems to guide users to more content. These AI programs were given the goal of maximizing user engagement (that is, the only goal was to keep people watching). The AI learned that users tended to choose misinformation, conspiracy theories, and extreme partisan content, and, to keep them watching, the AI recommended more of it. Users also tended to watch more content on the same subject, so the AI led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation. This convinced many users that the misinformation was true, and ultimately undermined trust in institutions, the media and the government. The AI program had correctly learned to maximize its goal, but the result was harmful to society. After the U.S. election in 2016, major technology companies took steps to mitigate the problem.\\nIn 2022, generative AI began to create images, audio, video and text that are indistinguishable from real photographs, recordings, films or human writing. It is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda. AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton expressed concern about AI enabling \"authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates\" on a large scale, among other risks.\\n\\n\\n==== Algorithmic bias and fairness ====\\n\\nMachine learning applications will be biased if they learn from biased data. The developers may not be aware that the bias exists.\\nBias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way a model is deployed. If a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people (as it can in medicine, finance, recruitment, housing or policing) then the algorithm may cause discrimination.\\nFairness in machine learning is the study of how to prevent the harm caused by algorithmic bias. It has become serious area of academic study within AI. Researchers have discovered it is not always possible to define \"fairness\" in a way that satisfies all stakeholders.\\nOn June 28, 2015, Google Photos\\'s new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as \"gorillas\" because they were black. The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people, a problem called \"sample size disparity\". Google \"fixed\" this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a \"gorilla\". Eight years later, in 2023, Google Photos still could not identify a gorilla, and neither could similar products from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon.\\nCOMPAS is a commercial program widely used by U.S. courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist.\\nIn 2016, Julia Angwin at ProPublica discovered that COMPAS exhibited racial bias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, the errors for each race were different—the system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend. In 2017, several researchers showed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data.\\nA program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such as \"race\" or \"gender\"). The feature will correlate with other features (like \"address\", \"shopping history\" or \"first name\"), and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on \"race\" or \"gender\".\\nMoritz Hardt said \"the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn\\'t work.\"\\nCriticism of COMPAS highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make \"predictions\" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. If an application then uses these predictions as recommendations, some of these \"recommendations\" will likely be racist. Thus, machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past. It is necessarily descriptive and not proscriptive.\\nBias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male: among AI engineers, about 4% are black and 20% are women.\\nAt its 2022 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT 2022), the Association for Computing Machinery, in Seoul, South Korea, presented and published findings that recommend that until AI and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes, they are unsafe, and the use of self-learning neural networks trained on vast, unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed.\\n\\n\\n==== Lack of transparency ====\\n\\nMany AI systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions. Particularly with deep neural networks, in which there are a large amount of non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs. But some popular explainability techniques exist.\\nIt is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works. There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended. For example, a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as \"cancerous\", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale. Another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at \"low risk\" of dying from pneumonia. Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor, but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care, they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data. The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading.\\nPeople who have been harmed by an algorithm\\'s decision have a right to an explanation. Doctors, for example, are expected to clearly and completely explain to their colleagues the reasoning behind any decision they make. Early drafts of the European Union\\'s General Data Protection Regulation in 2016 included an explicit statement that this right exists. Industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight. Regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real: if the problem has no solution, the tools should not be used.\\nDARPA established the XAI (\"Explainable Artificial Intelligence\") program in 2014 to try and solve these problems. \\nThere are several possible solutions to the transparency problem. SHAP tried to solve the transparency problems by visualising the contribution of each feature to the output. LIME can locally approximate a model with a simpler, interpretable model. Multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification. These other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned. Deconvolution, DeepDream and other generative methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network have learned and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning.\\n\\n\\n==== Bad actors and weaponized AI ====\\n\\nArtificial intelligence provides a number of tools that are useful to bad actors, such as authoritarian governments, terrorists, criminals or rogue states.\\nA lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates, selects and engages human targets without human supervision. Widely available AI tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and, if produced at scale, they are potentially weapons of mass destruction. Even when used in conventional warfare, it is unlikely that they will be unable to reliably choose targets and could potentially kill an innocent person. In 2014, 30 nations (including China) supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the United Nations\\' Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, however the United States and others disagreed. By 2015, over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots.\\nAI tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways. Face and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance. Machine learning, operating this data, can classify potential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding. Recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect. Deepfakes and generative AI aid in producing misinformation. Advanced AI can make authoritarian centralized decision making more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as markets. It lowers the cost and difficulty of digital warfare and advanced spyware. All these technologies have been available since 2020 or earlier—AI facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in China.\\nThere many other ways that AI is expected to help bad actors, some of which can not be foreseen. For example, machine-learning AI is able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours.\\n\\n\\n==== Reliance on industry giants ====\\nTraining AI systems requires an enormous amount of computing power. Usually only Big Tech companies have the financial resources to make such investments. Smaller startups such as Cohere and OpenAI end up buying access to data centers from Google and Microsoft respectively.\\n\\n\\n==== Technological unemployment ====\\n\\nEconomists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment.\\nIn the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that \"we\\'re in uncharted territory\" with AI. A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment, but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed. Risk estimates vary; for example, in the 2010s, Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimated 47% of U.S. jobs are at \"high risk\" of potential automation, while an OECD report classified only 9% of U.S. jobs as \"high risk\". The methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology, rather than social policy, creates unemployment, as opposed to redundancies. In April 2023, it was reported that 70% of the jobs for Chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence.\\nUnlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; The Economist stated in 2015 that \"the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution\" is \"worth taking seriously\". Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy.\\nFrom the early days of the development of artificial intelligence, there have been arguments, for example, those put forward by Joseph Weizenbaum, about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculation and qualitative, value-based judgement.\\n\\n\\n==== Existential risk ====\\n\\nIt has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. This could, as physicist Stephen Hawking stated, \"spell the end of the human race\". This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like \"self-awareness\" (or \"sentience\" or \"consciousness\") and becomes a malevolent character. These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways.\\nFirst, AI does not require human-like \"sentience\" to be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. Philosopher Nick Bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he used the example of a paperclip factory manager). Stuart Russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that \"you can\\'t fetch the coffee if you\\'re dead.\" In order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity\\'s morality and values so that it is \"fundamentally on our side\".\\nSecond, Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk. The essential parts of civilization are not physical. Things like ideologies, law, government, money and the economy are made of language; they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe. The current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive.\\nThe opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI. Personalities such as Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk have expressed concern about existential risk from AI.\\nAI pioneers including Fei-Fei Li, Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, Cynthia Breazeal, Rana el Kaliouby, Demis Hassabis, Joy Buolamwini, and Sam Altman have expressed concerns about the risks of AI. In 2023, many leading AI experts issued the joint statement that \"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war\".\\nOther researchers, however, spoke in favor of a less dystopian view. AI pioneer Juergen Schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement, emphasising that in 95% of all cases, AI research is about making \"human lives longer and healthier and easier.\" While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors, \"they can also be used against the bad actors.\" Andrew Ng also argued that \"it\\'s a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AI—and that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests.\" Yann LeCun \"scoffs at his peers\\' dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even, eventually, human extinction.\" In the early 2010s, experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine. However, after 2016, the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research.\\n\\n\\n=== Ethical machines and alignment ===\\n\\nFriendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans. Eliezer Yudkowsky, who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk.\\nMachines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas.\\nThe field of machine ethics is also called computational morality,\\nand was founded at an AAAI symposium in 2005.\\nOther approaches include Wendell Wallach\\'s \"artificial moral agents\" and Stuart J. Russell\\'s three principles for developing provably beneficial machines.\\n\\n\\n=== Open source ===\\nActive organizations in the AI open-source community include Hugging Face, Google, EleutherAI and Meta. Various AI models, such as Llama 2, Mistral or Stable Diffusion, have been made open-weight, meaning that their architecture and trained parameters (the \"weights\") are publicly available. Open-weight models can be freely fine-tuned, which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own use-case. Open-weight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused. Since they can be fine-tuned, any built-in security measure, such as objecting to harmful requests, can be trained away until it becomes ineffective. Some researchers warn that future AI models may develop dangerous capabilities (such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism), and that once released on the Internet, they can\\'t be deleted everywhere if needed. They recommend pre-release audits and cost-benefit analyses.\\n\\n\\n=== Frameworks ===\\nArtificial Intelligence projects can have their ethical permissibility tested while designing, developing, and implementing an AI system. An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework containing the SUM values—developed by the Alan Turing Institute tests projects in four main areas:\\n\\nRESPECT the dignity of individual people\\nCONNECT with other people sincerely, openly and inclusively\\nCARE for the wellbeing of everyone\\nPROTECT social values, justice and the public interest\\nOther developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the Asilomar Conference, the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI, and the IEEE\\'s Ethics of Autonomous Systems initiative, among others; however, these principles do not go without their criticisms, especially regards to the people chosen contributes to these frameworks.\\nPromotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of AI system design, development and implementation, and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists, product managers, data engineers, domain experts, and delivery managers.\\n\\n\\n=== Regulation ===\\n\\nThe regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating artificial intelligence (AI); it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms. The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally. According to AI Index at Stanford, the annual number of AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone. Between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI. Most EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, U.S., and Vietnam. Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia. The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology. Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI. In 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years. In 2023, the United Nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on AI governance; the body comprises technology company executives, governments officials and academics.\\nIn a 2022 Ipsos survey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78% of Chinese citizens, but only 35% of Americans, agreed that \"products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks\". A 2023 Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 61% of Americans agree, and 22% disagree, that AI poses risks to humanity. In a 2023 Fox News poll, 35% of Americans thought it \"very important\", and an additional 41% thought it \"somewhat important\", for the federal government to regulate AI, versus 13% responding \"not very important\" and 8% responding \"not at all important\".\\nIn November 2023, the first global AI Safety Summit was held in Bletchley Park in the UK to discuss the near and far term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks. 28 countries including the United States, China, and the European Union issued a declaration at the start of the summit, calling for international co-operation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nThe study of mechanical or \"formal\" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing\\'s theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning. This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics, information theory and neurobiology, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an \"electronic brain\". \\nThey developed several areas of research that would become part of AI,\\nsuch as McCullouch and Pitts design for \"artificial neurons\" in 1943, and Turing\\'s influential 1950 paper \\'Computing Machinery and Intelligence\\', which introduced the Turing test and showed that \"machine intelligence\" was plausible.\\nThe field of AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956. The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s. They and their students produced programs that the press described as \"astonishing\": computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English. Artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and U.S. Universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s.\\nResearchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field. Herbert Simon predicted, \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do\". Marvin Minsky agreed, writing, \"within a generation ... the problem of creating \\'artificial intelligence\\' will substantially be solved\". They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem. In 1974, both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from the U.S. Congress to fund more productive projects. Minsky\\'s and Papert\\'s book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether. The \"AI winter\", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed.\\nIn the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems, a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan\\'s fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research. However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.\\nUp to this point, most of AI\\'s funding had gone to projects that used high-level symbols to represent mental objects like plans, goals, beliefs, and known facts. In the 1980s, some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition, and began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches. Rodney Brooks rejected \"representation\" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive. Judea Pearl, Lofti Zadeh and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic. But the most important development was the revival of \"connectionism\", including neural network research, by Geoffrey Hinton and others. In 1990, Yann LeCun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits, the first of many successful applications of neural networks.\\nAI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems. This \"narrow\" and \"formal\" focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics, economics and mathematics). By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as \"artificial intelligence\".\\nHowever, several academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Beginning around 2002, they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or \"AGI\"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s.\\nDeep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field.\\nFor many specific tasks, other methods were abandoned.\\nDeep learning\\'s success was based on both hardware improvements (faster computers, graphics processing units, cloud computing) and access to large amounts of data (including curated datasets, such as ImageNet). Deep learning\\'s success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI. The amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019.\\nIn 2016, issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-focussed their careers on these issues. The alignment problem became a serious field of academic study.\\nIn the late teens and early 2020s, AGI companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest. In 2015, AlphaGo, developed by DeepMind, beat the world champion Go player. The program was taught only the rules of the game and developed strategy by itself. GPT-3 is a large language model that was released in 2020 by OpenAI and is capable of generating high-quality human-like text. These programs, and others, inspired an aggressive AI boom, where large companies began investing billions in AI research. According to AI Impacts, about $50 billion annually was invested in \"AI\" around 2022 in the U.S. alone and about 20% of the new U.S. Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in \"AI\".\\nAbout 800,000 \"AI\"-related U.S. job openings existed in 2022.\\n\\n\\n== Philosophy ==\\n\\n\\n=== Defining artificial intelligence ===\\n\\nAlan Turing wrote in 1950 \"I propose to consider the question \\'can machines think\\'?\" He advised changing the question from whether a machine \"thinks\", to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour\". He devised the Turing test, which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation. Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is \"actually\" thinking or literally has a \"mind\". Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but \"it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks\"\\nRussell and Norvig agree with Turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior, not internal structure. However, they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans. \"Aeronautical engineering texts,\" they wrote, \"do not define the goal of their field as making \\'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons.\\'\" AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that \"Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence\".\\nMcCarthy defines intelligence as \"the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world\". Another AI founder, Marvin Minsky similarly describes it as \"the ability to solve hard problems\". The leading AI textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. These definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the \"intelligence\" of the machine—and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible.\\nAnother definition has been adopted by Google, a major practitioner in the field of AI. This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence.\\n\\n\\n=== Evaluating approaches to AI ===\\nNo established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research for most of its history. The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to mean \"machine learning with neural networks\"). This approach is mostly sub-symbolic, soft and narrow. Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers.\\n\\n\\n==== Symbolic AI and its limits ====\\nSymbolic AI (or \"GOFAI\") simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at \"intelligent\" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis: \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\"\\nHowever, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning. Moravec\\'s paradox is the discovery that high-level \"intelligent\" tasks were easy for AI, but low level \"instinctive\" tasks were extremely difficult. Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a \"feel\" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge. Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him.\\nThe issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias. Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence, in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI: it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches.\\n\\n\\n==== Neat vs. scruffy ====\\n\\n\"Neats\" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic, optimization, or neural networks). \"Scruffies\" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s, but eventually was seen as irrelevant. Modern AI has elements of both.\\n\\n\\n==== Soft vs. hard computing ====\\n\\nFinding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems. Soft computing is a set of techniques, including genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks.\\n\\n\\n==== Narrow vs. general AI ====\\n\\nAI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field\\'s long-term goals. General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. The experimental sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively.\\n\\n\\n=== Machine consciousness, sentience, and mind ===\\n\\nThe philosophy of mind does not know whether a machine can have a mind, consciousness and mental states, in the same sense that human beings do. This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence. Russell and Norvig add that \"[t]he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on.\" However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind. It is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction.\\n\\n\\n==== Consciousness ====\\n\\nDavid Chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the \"hard\" and \"easy\" problems of consciousness. The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett\\'s consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). While human information processing is easy to explain, human subjective experience is difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like.\\n\\n\\n==== Computationalism and functionalism ====\\n\\nComputationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind–body problem. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam.\\nPhilosopher John Searle characterized this position as \"strong AI\": \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\" Searle counters this assertion with his Chinese room argument, which attempts to show that, even if a machine perfectly simulates human behavior, there is still no reason to suppose it also has a mind.\\n\\n\\n==== AI welfare and rights ====\\nIt is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient (has the ability to feel), and if so, to what degree. But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer, then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures, similarly to animals. Sapience (a set of capacities related to high intelligence, such as discernment or self-awareness) may provide another moral basis for AI rights. Robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society.\\nIn 2017, the European Union considered granting \"electronic personhood\" to some of the most capable AI systems. Similarly to the legal status of companies, it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities. Critics argued in 2018 that granting rights to AI systems would downplay the importance of human rights, and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios. They also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part to society on their own.\\nProgress in AI increased interest in the topic. Proponents of AI welfare and rights often argue that AI sentience, if it emerges, would be particularly easy to deny. They warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming, which could lead to large-scale suffering if sentient AI is created and carelessly exploited.\\n\\n\\n== Future ==\\n\\n\\n=== Superintelligence and the singularity ===\\nA superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind.\\nIf research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what I. J. Good called an \"intelligence explosion\" and Vernor Vinge called a \"singularity\".\\nHowever, technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely, and typically follow an S-shaped curve, slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do.\\n\\n\\n=== Transhumanism ===\\nRobot designer Hans Moravec, cyberneticist Kevin Warwick, and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger.\\nEdward Fredkin argues that \"artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution\", an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler\\'s \"Darwin among the Machines\" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by George Dyson in his book of the same name in 1998.\\n\\n\\n== In fiction ==\\n\\nThought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity, and have been a persistent theme in science fiction.\\nA common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley\\'s Frankenstein, where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. This includes such works as Arthur C. Clarke\\'s and Stanley Kubrick\\'s 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968), with HAL 9000, the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984) and The Matrix (1999). In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Bishop from Aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture.\\nIsaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many books and stories, most notably the \"Multivac\" series about a super-intelligent computer of the same name. Asimov\\'s laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics; while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov\\'s laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity.\\nSeveral works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel, and thus to suffer. This appears in Karel Čapek\\'s R.U.R., the films A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina, as well as the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, by Philip K. Dick. Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nArtificial intelligence detection software – Software to detect AI-generated contentPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\\nBehavior selection algorithm – Algorithm that selects actions for intelligent agents\\nBusiness process automation – Technology-enabled automation of complex business processes\\nCase-based reasoning – Process of solving new problems based on the solutions of similar past problems\\nComputational intelligence – Ability of a computer to learn a specific task from data or experimental observation\\nDigital immortality – Hypothetical concept of storing a personality in digital form\\nEmergent algorithm – Algorithm exhibiting emergent behavior\\nFemale gendering of AI technologies – Gender biases in digital technologyPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\\nGlossary of artificial intelligence – List of definitions of terms and concepts commonly used in the study of artificial intelligence\\nIntelligence amplification – Use of information technology to augment human intelligence\\nMind uploading – Hypothetical process of digitally emulating a brain\\nRobotic process automation – Form of business process automation technology\\nWeak artificial intelligence – Form of artificial intelligence\\nWetware computer – Computer composed of organic material\\n\\n\\n== Explanatory notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== AI textbooks ===\\nThe two most widely used textbooks in 2023.

            "[' deep learning is the subset of machine learning methods based on neural networks with representation learning  the adjective  deep  refers to the use of multiple layers in the network  methods used can be either supervised  semi supervised or unsupervised  deep learning architectures such as deep neural networks  deep belief networks  recurrent neural networks  convolutional neural networks and transformers have been applied to fields including computer vision  speech recognition  natural language processing  machine translation  bioinformatics  drug design  medical image analysis  climate science  material inspection and board game programs  where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance  early forms of neural networks were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems  in particular the human brain  however  current neural networks do not intend to model the brain function of organisms  and are generally seen as low quality models for that purpose     overview    most modern deep learning models are based on multi layered neural networks such as convolutional neural networks and transformers  although they can also include propositional formulas or latent variables organized layer wise in deep generative models such as the nodes in deep belief networks and deep boltzmann machines  fundamentally  deep learning refers to class of machine learning algorithms in which hierarchy of layers is used to transform input data into slightly more abstract and composite representation  for example  in an image recognition model  the raw input may be an image  represented as tensor of pixels   the first representational layer may attempt to identify basic shapes such as lines and circles  the second layer may compose and encode arrangements of edges  the third layer may encode nose and eyes  and the fourth layer may recognize that the image contains face  importantly deep learning process can learn which features to optimally place in which level on its own  prior to deep learning  machine learning techniques often involved hand crafted feature engineering to transform the data into more suitable representation for classification algorithm to operate upon  in the deep learning approach  features are not hand crafted and the model discovers useful feature representations from the data automatically  this does not eliminate the need for hand tuning  for example  varying numbers of layers and layer sizes can provide different degrees of abstraction  the word  deep  in  deep learning  refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed  more precisely  deep learning systems have substantial credit assignment path  cap  depth  the cap is the chain of transformations from input to output  caps describe potentially causal connections between input and output  for feedforward neural network  the depth of the caps is that of the network and is the number of hidden layers plus one  as the output layer is also parameterized   for recurrent neural networks  in which signal may propagate through layer more than once  the cap depth is potentially unlimited  no universally agreed upon threshold of depth divides shallow learning from deep learning  but most researchers agree that deep learning involves cap depth higher than   cap of depth  has been shown to be universal approximator in the sense that it can emulate any function  beyond that  more layers do not add to the function approximator ability of the network  deep models  cap     are able to extract better features than shallow models and hence  extra layers help in learning the features effectively  deep learning architectures can be constructed with greedy layer by layer method  deep learning helps to disentangle these abstractions and pick out which features improve performance  deep learning algorithms can be applied to unsupervised learning tasks  this is an important benefit because unlabeled data are more abundant than the labeled data  examples of deep structures that can be trained in an unsupervised manner are deep belief networks     interpretations    deep neural networks are generally interpreted in terms of the universal approximation theorem or probabilistic inference  the classic universal approximation theorem concerns the capacity of feedforward neural networks with single hidden layer of finite size to approximate continuous functions  in   the first proof was published by george cybenko for sigmoid activation functions and was generalised to feed forward multi layer architectures in  by kurt hornik  recent work also showed that universal approximation also holds for non bounded activation functions such as kunihiko fukushima rectified linear unit  the universal approximation theorem for deep neural networks concerns the capacity of networks with bounded width but the depth is allowed to grow  lu et al  proved that if the width of deep neural network with relu activation is strictly larger than the input dimension  then the network can approximate any lebesgue integrable function  if the width is smaller or equal to the input dimension  then deep neural network is not universal approximator  the probabilistic interpretation derives from the field of machine learning  it features inference  as well as the optimization concepts of training and testing  related to fitting and generalization  respectively  more specifically  the probabilistic interpretation considers the activation nonlinearity as cumulative distribution function  the probabilistic interpretation led to the introduction of dropout as regularizer in neural networks  the probabilistic interpretation was introduced by researchers including hopfield  widrow and narendra and popularized in surveys such as the one by bishop     history    there were two types of artificial neural network  ann   feedforward neural networks  fnns  and recurrent neural networks  rnns   rnns have cycles in their connectivity structure  fnns don in the s  wilhelm lenz and ernst ising created and analyzed the ising model which is essentially non learning rnn architecture consisting of neuron like threshold elements  in   shun ichi amari made this architecture adaptive  his learning rnn was popularised by john hopfield in   charles tappert writes that frank rosenblatt developed and explored all of the basic ingredients of the deep learning systems of today  referring to rosenblatt  book which introduced multilayer perceptron  mlp  with  layers  an input layer hidden layer with randomized weights that did not learn  and an output layer  it also introduced variants  including version with four layer perceptrons where the last two layers have learned weights  and thus proper multilayer perceptron    section  in addition  term deep learning was proposed in  by rina dechter although the history of its appearance is apparently more complicated  the first general  working learning algorithm for supervised  deep  feedforward  multilayer perceptrons was published by alexey ivakhnenko and lapa in   paper described deep network with eight layers trained by the group method of data handling  the first deep learning multilayer perceptron trained by stochastic gradient descent was published in  by shun ichi amari  in computer experiments conducted by amari student saito five layer mlp with two modifiable layers learned internal representations to classify non linearily separable pattern classes  in  matthew brand reported that wide  layer nonlinear perceptrons could be fully end to end trained to reproduce logic functions of nontrivial circuit depth via gradient descent on small batches of random input output samples  but concluded that training time on contemporary hardware  sub megaflop computers  made the technique impractical  and proposed using fixed random early layers as an input hash for single modifiable layer  instead  subsequent developments in hardware and hyperparameter tunings have made end to end stochastic gradient descent the currently dominant training technique  in   seppo linnainmaa published the reverse mode of automatic differentiation of discrete connected networks of nested differentiable functions  this became known as backpropagation  it is an efficient application of the chain rule derived by gottfried wilhelm leibniz in  to networks of differentiable nodes  the terminology  back propagating errors  was actually introduced in  by rosenblatt  but he did not know how to implement this  although henry kelley had continuous precursor of backpropagation already in  in the context of control theory  in   paul werbos applied backpropagation to mlps in the way that has become standard  in   david rumelhart et al  published an experimental analysis of the technique  deep learning architectures for convolutional neural networks  cnns  with convolutional layers and downsampling layers began with the neocognitron introduced by kunihiko fukushima in   in   he also introduced the relu  rectified linear unit  activation function  the rectifier has become the most popular activation function for cnns and deep learning in general  cnns have become an essential tool for computer vision  the term deep learning was introduced to the machine learning community by rina dechter in   and to artificial neural networks by igor aizenberg and colleagues in   in the context of boolean threshold neurons  in   wei zhang et al  applied the backpropagation algorithm to convolutional neural network simplified neocognitron with convolutional interconnections between the image feature layers and the last fully connected layer  for alphabet recognition  they also proposed an implementation of the cnn with an optical computing system  in   yann lecun et al  applied backpropagation to cnn with the purpose of recognizing handwritten zip codes on mail  while the algorithm worked  training required  days  subsequently  wei zhang  et al  modified their model by removing the last fully connected layer and applied it for medical image object segmentation in  and breast cancer detection in mammograms in   lenet     level cnn by yann lecun et al   that classifies digits  was applied by several banks to recognize hand written numbers on checks digitized in x pixel images  in the s  backpropagation did not work well for deep learning with long credit assignment paths  to overcome this problem  jrgen schmidhuber    proposed hierarchy of rnns pre trained one level at time by self supervised learning  it uses predictive coding to learn internal representations at multiple self organizing time scales  this can substantially facilitate downstream deep learning  the rnn hierarchy can be collapsed into single rnn  by distilling higher level chunker network into lower level automatizer network  in  chunker solved deep learning task whose depth exceeded   in   jrgen schmidhuber also published an alternative to rnns which is now called linear transformer or transformer with linearized self attention  save for normalization operator   it learns internal spotlights of attention slow feedforward neural network learns by gradient descent to control the fast weights of another neural network through outer products of self generated activation patterns from and to  which are now called key and value for self attention   this fast weight attention mapping is applied to query pattern  the modern transformer was introduced by ashish vaswani et al  in their  paper  attention is all you need   it combines this with softmax operator and projection matrix  transformers have increasingly become the model of choice for natural language processing  many modern large language models such as chatgpt  gpt   and bert use it  transformers are also increasingly being used in computer vision  in   jrgen schmidhuber also published adversarial neural networks that contest with each other in the form of zero sum game  where one network gain is the other network loss  the first network is generative model that models probability distribution over output patterns  the second network learns by gradient descent to predict the reactions of the environment to these patterns  this was called  artificial curiosity   in   this principle was used in generative adversarial network  gan  by ian goodfellow et al  here the environmental reaction is  or  depending on whether the first network output is in given set  this can be used to create realistic deepfakes  excellent image quality is achieved by nvidia stylegan    based on the progressive gan by tero karras et al  here the gan generator is grown from small to large scale in pyramidal fashion  sepp hochreiter diploma thesis    was called  one of the most important documents in the history of machine learning  by his supervisor schmidhuber  it not only tested the neural history compressor  but also identified and analyzed the vanishing gradient problem  hochreiter proposed recurrent residual connections to solve this problem  this led to the deep learning method called long short term memory  lstm   published in   lstm recurrent neural networks can learn  very deep learning  tasks with long credit assignment paths that require memories of events that happened thousands of discrete time steps before  the  vanilla lstm  with forget gate was introduced in  by felix gers  schmidhuber and fred cummins  lstm has become the most cited neural network of the th century  in   rupesh kumar srivastava  klaus greff  and schmidhuber used lstm principles to create the highway network feedforward neural network with hundreds of layers  much deeper than previous networks   months later  kaiming he  xiangyu zhang  shaoqing ren  and jian sun won the imagenet  competition with an open gated or gateless highway network variant called residual neural network  this has become the most cited neural network of the st century  in   andr de carvalho  together with mike fairhurst and david bisset  published experimental results of multi layer boolean neural network  also known as weightless neural network  composed of  layers self organising feature extraction neural network module  soft  followed by multi layer classification neural network module  gsn   which were independently trained  each layer in the feature extraction module extracted features with growing complexity regarding the previous layer  in   brendan frey demonstrated that it was possible to train  over two days network containing six fully connected layers and several hundred hidden units using the wake sleep algorithm  co developed with peter dayan and hinton  since   sven behnke extended the feed forward hierarchical convolutional approach in the neural abstraction pyramid by lateral and backward connections in order to flexibly incorporate context into decisions and iteratively resolve local ambiguities  simpler models that use task specific handcrafted features such as gabor filters and support vector machines  svms  were popular choice in the s and s  because of artificial neural networks  computational cost and lack of understanding of how the brain wires its biological networks  both shallow and deep learning g   recurrent nets  of anns for speech recognition have been explored for many years  these methods never outperformed non uniform internal handcrafting gaussian mixture model hidden markov model  gmm hmm  technology based on generative models of speech trained discriminatively  key difficulties have been analyzed  including gradient diminishing and weak temporal correlation structure in neural predictive models  additional difficulties were the lack of training data and limited computing power  most speech recognition researchers moved away from neural nets to pursue generative modeling  an exception was at sri international in the late s  funded by the us government nsa and darpa  sri studied deep neural networks  dnns  in speech and speaker recognition  the speaker recognition team led by larry heck reported significant success with deep neural networks in speech processing in the  national institute of standards and technology speaker recognition evaluation  the sri deep neural network was then deployed in the nuance verifier  representing the first major industrial application of deep learning  the principle of elevating  raw  features over hand crafted optimization was first explored successfully in the architecture of deep autoencoder on the  raw  spectrogram or linear filter bank features in the late s  showing its superiority over the mel cepstral features that contain stages of fixed transformation from spectrograms  the raw features of speech  waveforms  later produced excellent larger scale results  speech recognition was taken over by lstm  in   lstm started to become competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks  in   alex graves  santiago fernndez  faustino gomez  and schmidhuber combined it with connectionist temporal classification  ctc  in stacks of lstm rnns  in   google speech recognition reportedly experienced dramatic performance jump of   through ctc trained lstm  which they made available through google voice search  the impact of deep learning in industry began in the early s  when cnns already processed an estimated   to   of all the checks written in the us  according to yann lecun  industrial applications of deep learning to large scale speech recognition started around   in   publications by geoff hinton  ruslan salakhutdinov  osindero and teh showed how many layered feedforward neural network could be effectively pre trained one layer at time  treating each layer in turn as an unsupervised restricted boltzmann machine  then fine tuning it using supervised backpropagation  the papers referred to learning for deep belief nets  the  nips workshop on deep learning for speech recognition was motivated by the limitations of deep generative models of speech  and the possibility that given more capable hardware and large scale data sets that deep neural nets might become practical  it was believed that pre training dnns using generative models of deep belief nets  dbn  would overcome the main difficulties of neural nets  however  it was discovered that replacing pre training with large amounts of training data for straightforward backpropagation when using dnns with large  context dependent output layers produced error rates dramatically lower than then state of the art gaussian mixture model  gmm  hidden markov model  hmm  and also than more advanced generative model based systems  the nature of the recognition errors produced by the two types of systems was characteristically different  offering technical insights into how to integrate deep learning into the existing highly efficient  run time speech decoding system deployed by all major speech recognition systems  analysis around    contrasting the gmm  and other generative speech models  vs  dnn models  stimulated early industrial investment in deep learning for speech recognition  that analysis was done with comparable performance  less than    in error rate  between discriminative dnns and generative models  in   researchers extended deep learning from timit to large vocabulary speech recognition  by adopting large output layers of the dnn based on context dependent hmm states constructed by decision trees  deep learning is part of state of the art systems in various disciplines  particularly computer vision and automatic speech recognition  asr   results on commonly used evaluation sets such as timit  asr  and mnist  image classification   as well as range of large vocabulary speech recognition tasks have steadily improved  convolutional neural networks were superseded for asr by ctc for lstm  but are more successful in computer vision  advances in hardware have driven renewed interest in deep learning  in   nvidia was involved in what was called the  big bang  of deep learning   as deep learning neural networks were trained with nvidia graphics processing units  gpus    that year  andrew ng determined that gpus could increase the speed of deep learning systems by about  times  in particular  gpus are well suited for the matrix vector computations involved in machine learning  gpus speed up training algorithms by orders of magnitude  reducing running times from weeks to days  further  specialized hardware and algorithm optimizations can be used for efficient processing of deep learning models      deep learning revolution     in the late s  deep learning started to outperform other methods in machine learning competitions  in  long short term memory trained by connectionist temporal classification  alex graves  santiago fernndez  faustino gomez  and jrgen schmidhuber    was the first rnn to win pattern recognition contests  winning three competitions in connected handwriting recognition  google later used ctc trained lstm for speech recognition on the smartphone  significant impacts in image or object recognition were felt from  to   although cnns trained by backpropagation had been around for decades  and gpu implementations of nns for years  including cnns  faster implementations of cnns on gpus were needed to progress on computer vision  in   the dannet by dan ciresan  ueli meier  jonathan masci  luca maria gambardella  and jrgen schmidhuber achieved for the first time superhuman performance in visual pattern recognition contest  outperforming traditional methods by factor of   also in   dannet won the icdar chinese handwriting contest  and in may   it won the isbi image segmentation contest  until   cnns did not play major role at computer vision conferences  but in june  paper by ciresan et al  at the leading conference cvpr showed how max pooling cnns on gpu can dramatically improve many vision benchmark records  in september   dannet also won the icpr contest on analysis of large medical images for cancer detection  and in the following year also the miccai grand challenge on the same topic  in october   the similar alexnet by alex krizhevsky  ilya sutskever  and geoffrey hinton won the large scale imagenet competition by significant margin over shallow machine learning methods  the vgg  network by karen simonyan and andrew zisserman further reduced the error rate and won the imagenet  competition  following similar trend in large scale speech recognition  image classification was then extended to the more challenging task of generating descriptions  captions  for images  often as combination of cnns and lstms  in  team led by george dahl won the  merck molecular activity challenge  using multi task deep neural networks to predict the biomolecular target of one drug  in   sepp hochreiter group used deep learning to detect off target and toxic effects of environmental chemicals in nutrients  household products and drugs and won the  tox data challenge  of nih  fda and ncats  in   roger parloff mentioned deep learning revolution  that has transformed the ai industry  in march   yoshua bengio  geoffrey hinton and yann lecun were awarded the turing award for conceptual and engineering breakthroughs that have made deep neural networks critical component of computing     neural networks    artificial neural networks  anns  or connectionist systems are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains  such systems learn  progressively improve their ability  to do tasks by considering examples  generally without task specific programming  for example  in image recognition  they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as  cat  or  no cat  and using the analytic results to identify cats in other images  they have found most use in applications difficult to express with traditional computer algorithm using rule based programming  an ann is based on collection of connected units called artificial neurons   analogous to biological neurons in biological brain   each connection  synapse  between neurons can transmit signal to another neuron  the receiving  postsynaptic  neuron can process the signal and then signal downstream neurons connected to it  neurons may have state  generally represented by real numbers  typically between  and   neurons and synapses may also have weight that varies as learning proceeds  which can increase or decrease the strength of the signal that it sends downstream  typically  neurons are organized in layers  different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs  signals travel from the first  input   to the last  output  layer  possibly after traversing the layers multiple times  the original goal of the neural network approach was to solve problems in the same way that human brain would  over time  attention focused on matching specific mental abilities  leading to deviations from biology such as backpropagation  or passing information in the reverse direction and adjusting the network to reflect that information  neural networks have been used on variety of tasks  including computer vision  speech recognition  machine translation  social network filtering  playing board and video games and medical diagnosis  as of   neural networks typically have few thousand to few million units and millions of connections  despite this number being several order of magnitude less than the number of neurons on human brain  these networks can perform many tasks at level beyond that of humans g   recognizing faces  or playing  go        deep neural networks deep neural network  dnn  is an artificial neural network with multiple layers between the input and output layers  there are different types of neural networks but they always consist of the same components  neurons  synapses  weights  biases  and functions  these components as whole function in way that mimics functions of the human brain  and can be trained like any other ml algorithm  for example dnn that is trained to recognize dog breeds will go over the given image and calculate the probability that the dog in the image is certain breed  the user can review the results and select which probabilities the network should display  above certain threshold  etc   and return the proposed label  each mathematical manipulation as such is considered layer  and complex dnn have many layers  hence the name  deep  networks  dnns can model complex non linear relationships  dnn architectures generate compositional models where the object is expressed as layered composition of primitives  the extra layers enable composition of features from lower layers  potentially modeling complex data with fewer units than similarly performing shallow network  for instance  it was proved that sparse multivariate polynomials are exponentially easier to approximate with dnns than with shallow networks  deep architectures include many variants of few basic approaches  each architecture has found success in specific domains  it is not always possible to compare the performance of multiple architectures  unless they have been evaluated on the same data sets  dnns are typically feedforward networks in which data flows from the input layer to the output layer without looping back  at first  the dnn creates map of virtual neurons and assigns random numerical values  or  weights   to connections between them  the weights and inputs are multiplied and return an output between  and   if the network did not accurately recognize particular pattern  an algorithm would adjust the weights  that way the algorithm can make certain parameters more influential  until it determines the correct mathematical manipulation to fully process the data  recurrent neural networks  in which data can flow in any direction  are used for applications such as language modeling  long short term memory is particularly effective for this use  convolutional neural networks  cnns  are used in computer vision  cnns also have been applied to acoustic modeling for automatic speech recognition  asr        challenges      as with anns  many issues can arise with naively trained dnns  two common issues are overfitting and computation time  dnns are prone to overfitting because of the added layers of abstraction  which allow them to model rare dependencies in the training data  regularization methods such as ivakhnenko unit pruning or weight decay       displaystyle  ell      regularization  or sparsity       displaystyle  ell      regularization  can be applied during training to combat overfitting  alternatively dropout regularization randomly omits units from the hidden layers during training  this helps to exclude rare dependencies  finally  data can be augmented via methods such as cropping and rotating such that smaller training sets can be increased in size to reduce the chances of overfitting  dnns must consider many training parameters  such as the size  number of layers and number of units per layer   the learning rate  and initial weights  sweeping through the parameter space for optimal parameters may not be feasible due to the cost in time and computational resources  various tricks  such as batching  computing the gradient on several training examples at once rather than individual examples  speed up computation  large processing capabilities of many core architectures  such as gpus or the intel xeon phi  have produced significant speedups in training  because of the suitability of such processing architectures for the matrix and vector computations  alternatively  engineers may look for other types of neural networks with more straightforward and convergent training algorithms  cmac  cerebellar model articulation controller  is one such kind of neural network  it doesn require learning rates or randomized initial weights  the training process can be guaranteed to converge in one step with new batch of data  and the computational complexity of the training algorithm is linear with respect to the number of neurons involved     hardware    since the s  advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks that contain many layers of non linear hidden units and very large output layer  by   graphic processing units  gpus   often with ai specific enhancements  had displaced cpus as the dominant method of training large scale commercial cloud ai  openai estimated the hardware computation used in the largest deep learning projects from alexnet    to alphazero     and found   fold increase in the amount of computation required  with doubling time trendline of   months  special electronic circuits called deep learning processors were designed to speed up deep learning algorithms  deep learning processors include neural processing units  npus  in huawei cellphones and cloud computing servers such as tensor processing units  tpu  in the google cloud platform  cerebras systems has also built dedicated system to handle large deep learning models  the cs   based on the largest processor in the industry  the second generation wafer scale engine  wse    atomically thin semiconductors are considered promising for energy efficient deep learning hardware where the same basic device structure is used for both logic operations and data storage  in   marega et al  published experiments with large area active channel material for developing logic in memory devices and circuits based on floating gate field effect transistors  fgfets   in  feldmann et al  proposed an integrated photonic hardware accelerator for parallel convolutional processing  the authors identify two key advantages of integrated photonics over its electronic counterparts     massively parallel data transfer through wavelength division multiplexing in conjunction with frequency combs  and    extremely high data modulation speeds  their system can execute trillions of multiply accumulate operations per second  indicating the potential of integrated photonics in data heavy ai applications     applications        automatic speech recognition     large scale automatic speech recognition is the first and most convincing successful case of deep learning  lstm rnns can learn  very deep learning  tasks that involve multi second intervals containing speech events separated by thousands of discrete time steps  where one time step corresponds to about  ms  lstm with forget gates is competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks  the initial success in speech recognition was based on small scale recognition tasks based on timit  the data set contains  speakers from eight major dialects of american english  where each speaker reads  sentences  its small size lets many configurations be tried  more importantly  the timit task concerns phone sequence recognition  which  unlike word sequence recognition  allows weak phone bigram language models  this lets the strength of the acoustic modeling aspects of speech recognition be more easily analyzed  the error rates listed below  including these early results and measured as percent phone error rates  per   have been summarized since   the debut of dnns for speaker recognition in the late s and speech recognition around   and of lstm around    accelerated progress in eight major areas  scale up out and accelerated

and transfer learning by dnns and related deep models cnns and how to design them to best exploit domain knowledge of speech rnn and its rich lstm variants other types of deep models including tensor based models and integrated deep generative discriminative models  all major commercial speech recognition systems g   microsoft cortana  xbox  skype translator  amazon alexa  google now  apple siri  baidu and iflytek voice search  and range of nuance speech products  etc   are based on deep learning      image recognition common evaluation set for image classification is the mnist database data set  mnist is composed of handwritten digits and includes   training examples and   test examples  as with timit  its small size lets users test multiple configurations comprehensive list of results on this set is available  deep learning based image recognition has become  superhuman   producing more accurate results than human contestants  this first occurred in  in recognition of traffic signs  and in   with recognition of human faces  deep learning trained vehicles now interpret   camera views  another example is facial dysmorphology novel analysis  fdna  used to analyze cases of human malformation connected to large database of genetic syndromes      visual art processing     closely related to the progress that has been made in image recognition is the increasing application of deep learning techniques to various visual art tasks  dnns have proven themselves capable  for example  of identifying the style period of given painting neural style transfer   capturing the style of given artwork and applying it in visually pleasing manner to an arbitrary photograph or video generating striking imagery based on random visual input fields      natural language processing     neural networks have been used for implementing language models since the early s  lstm helped to improve machine translation and language modeling  other key techniques in this field are negative sampling and word embedding  word embedding  such as wordvec  can be thought of as representational layer in deep learning architecture that transforms an atomic word into positional representation of the word relative to other words in the dataset  the position is represented as point in vector space  using word embedding as an rnn input layer allows the network to parse sentences and phrases using an effective compositional vector grammar compositional vector grammar can be thought of as probabilistic context free grammar  pcfg  implemented by an rnn  recursive auto encoders built atop word embeddings can assess sentence similarity and detect paraphrasing  deep neural architectures provide the best results for constituency parsing  sentiment analysis  information retrieval  spoken language understanding  machine translation  contextual entity linking  writing style recognition  named entity recognition  token classification   text classification  and others  recent developments generalize word embedding to sentence embedding  google translate  gt  uses large end to end long short term memory  lstm  network  google neural machine translation  gnmt  uses an example based machine translation method in which the system  learns from millions of examples   it translates  whole sentences at time  rather than pieces   google translate supports over one hundred languages  the network encodes the  semantics of the sentence rather than simply memorizing phrase to phrase translations   gt uses english as an intermediate between most language pairs      drug discovery and toxicology large percentage of candidate drugs fail to win regulatory approval  these failures are caused by insufficient efficacy  on target effect   undesired interactions  off target effects   or unanticipated toxic effects  research has explored use of deep learning to predict the biomolecular targets  off targets  and toxic effects of environmental chemicals in nutrients  household products and drugs  atomnet is deep learning system for structure based rational drug design  atomnet was used to predict novel candidate biomolecules for disease targets such as the ebola virus and multiple sclerosis  in  graph neural networks were used for the first time to predict various properties of molecules in large toxicology data set  in   generative neural networks were used to produce molecules that were validated experimentally all the way into mice      customer relationship management     deep reinforcement learning has been used to approximate the value of possible direct marketing actions  defined in terms of rfm variables  the estimated value function was shown to have natural interpretation as customer lifetime value      recommendation systems     recommendation systems have used deep learning to extract meaningful features for latent factor model for content based music and journal recommendations  multi view deep learning has been applied for learning user preferences from multiple domains  the model uses hybrid collaborative and content based approach and enhances recommendations in multiple tasks      bioinformatics     an autoencoder ann was used in bioinformatics  to predict gene ontology annotations and gene function relationships  in medical informatics  deep learning was used to predict sleep quality based on data from wearables and predictions of health complications from electronic health record data      deep neural network estimations     deep neural networks can be used to estimate the entropy of stochastic process and called neural joint entropy estimator  njee   such an estimation provides insights on the effects of input random variables on an independent random variable  practically  the dnn is trained as classifier that maps an input vector or matrix to an output probability distribution over the possible classes of random variable given input for example  in image classification tasks  the njee maps vector of pixels  color values to probabilities over possible image classes  in practice  the probability distribution of is obtained by softmax layer with number of nodes that is equal to the alphabet size of njee uses continuously differentiable activation functions  such that the conditions for the universal approximation theorem holds  it is shown that this method provides strongly consistent estimator and outperforms other methods in case of large alphabet sizes      medical image analysis     deep learning has been shown to produce competitive results in medical application such as cancer cell classification  lesion detection  organ segmentation and image enhancement  modern deep learning tools demonstrate the high accuracy of detecting various diseases and the helpfulness of their use by specialists to improve the diagnosis efficiency      mobile advertising     finding the appropriate mobile audience for mobile advertising is always challenging  since many data points must be considered and analyzed before target segment can be created and used in ad serving by any ad server  deep learning has been used to interpret large  many dimensioned advertising datasets  many data points are collected during the request serve click internet advertising cycle  this information can form the basis of machine learning to improve ad selection      image restoration     deep learning has been successfully applied to inverse problems such as denoising  super resolution  inpainting  and film colorization  these applications include learning methods such as  shrinkage fields for effective image restoration  which trains on an image dataset  and deep image prior  which trains on the image that needs restoration      financial fraud detection     deep learning is being successfully applied to financial fraud detection  tax evasion detection  and anti money laundering      materials science     in november   researchers at google deepmind and lawrence berkeley national laboratory announced that they had developed an ai system known as gnome  this system has contributed to materials science by discovering over  million new materials within relatively short timeframe  gnome employs deep learning techniques to efficiently explore potential material structures  achieving significant increase in the identification of stable inorganic crystal structures  the system predictions were validated through autonomous robotic experiments  demonstrating noteworthy success rate of    the data of newly discovered materials is publicly available through the materials project database  offering researchers the opportunity to identify materials with desired properties for various applications  this development has implications for the future of scientific discovery and the integration of ai in material science research  potentially expediting material innovation and reducing costs in product development  the use of ai and deep learning suggests the possibility of minimizing or eliminating manual lab experiments and allowing scientists to focus more on the design and analysis of unique compounds      military     the united states department of defense applied deep learning to train robots in new tasks through observation      partial differential equations     physics informed neural networks have been used to solve partial differential equations in both forward and inverse problems in data driven manner  one example is the reconstructing fluid flow governed by the navier stokes equations  using physics informed neural networks does not require the often expensive mesh generation that conventional cfd methods relies on      image reconstruction     image reconstruction is the reconstruction of the underlying images from the image related measurements  several works showed the better and superior performance of the deep learning methods compared to analytical methods for various applications g   spectral imaging and ultrasound imaging      epigenetic clock     an epigenetic clock is biochemical test that can be used to measure age  galkin et al  used deep neural networks to train an epigenetic aging clock of unprecedented accuracy using    blood samples  the clock uses information from  cpg sites and predicts people with certain conditions older than healthy controls  ibd  frontotemporal dementia  ovarian cancer  obesity  the aging clock was planned to be released for public use in  by an insilico medicine spinoff company deep longevity     relation to human cognitive and brain development    deep learning is closely related to class of theories of brain development  specifically  neocortical development  proposed by cognitive neuroscientists in the early s  these developmental theories were instantiated in computational models  making them predecessors of deep learning systems  these developmental models share the property that various proposed learning dynamics in the brain g wave of nerve growth factor  support the self organization somewhat analogous to the neural networks utilized in deep learning models  like the neocortex  neural networks employ hierarchy of layered filters in which each layer considers information from prior layer  or the operating environment   and then passes its output  and possibly the original input   to other layers  this process yields self organizing stack of transducers  well tuned to their operating environment  description stated      the infant brain seems to organize itself under the influence of waves of so called trophic factors     different regions of the brain become connected sequentially  with one layer of tissue maturing before another and so on until the whole brain is mature variety of approaches have been used to investigate the plausibility of deep learning models from neurobiological perspective  on the one hand  several variants of the backpropagation algorithm have been proposed in order to increase its processing realism  other researchers have argued that unsupervised forms of deep learning  such as those based on hierarchical generative models and deep belief networks  may be closer to biological reality  in this respect  generative neural network models have been related to neurobiological evidence about sampling based processing in the cerebral cortex  although systematic comparison between the human brain organization and the neuronal encoding in deep networks has not yet been established  several analogies have been reported  for example  the computations performed by deep learning units could be similar to those of actual neurons and neural populations  similarly  the representations developed by deep learning models are similar to those measured in the primate visual system both at the single unit and at the population levels     commercial activity    facebook ai lab performs tasks such as automatically tagging uploaded pictures with the names of the people in them  google deepmind technologies developed system capable of learning how to play atari video games using only pixels as data input  in  they demonstrated their alphago system  which learned the game of go well enough to beat professional go player  google translate uses neural network to translate between more than  languages  in   covariant ai was launched  which focuses on integrating deep learning into factories  as of   researchers at the university of texas at austin  ut  developed machine learning framework called training an agent manually via evaluative reinforcement  or tamer  which proposed new methods for robots or computer programs to learn how to perform tasks by interacting with human instructor  first developed as tamer new algorithm called deep tamer was later introduced in  during collaboration between s  army research laboratory  arl  and ut researchers  deep tamer used deep learning to provide robot with the ability to learn new tasks through observation  using deep tamer robot learned task with human trainer  watching video streams or observing human perform task in person  the robot later practiced the task with the help of some coaching from the trainer  who provided feedback such as  good job  and  bad job      criticism and comment    deep learning has attracted both criticism and comment  in some cases from outside the field of computer science      theory main criticism concerns the lack of theory surrounding some methods  learning in the most common deep architectures is implemented using well understood gradient descent  however  the theory surrounding other algorithms  such as contrastive divergence is less clear g   does it converge  if so  how fast  what is it approximating   deep learning methods are often looked at as black box  with most confirmations done empirically  rather than theoretically  others point out that deep learning should be looked at as step towards realizing strong ai  not as an all encompassing solution  despite the power of deep learning methods  they still lack much of the functionality needed to realize this goal entirely  research psychologist gary marcus noted  realistically  deep learning is only part of the larger challenge of building intelligent machines  such techniques lack ways of representing causal relationships       have no obvious ways of performing logical inferences  and they are also still long way from integrating abstract knowledge  such as information about what objects are  what they are for  and how they are typically used  the most powerful i  systems  like watson       use techniques like deep learning as just one element in very complicated ensemble of techniques  ranging from the statistical technique of bayesian inference to deductive reasoning  in further reference to the idea that artistic sensitivity might be inherent in relatively low levels of the cognitive hierarchy published series of graphic representations of the internal states of deep    layers  neural networks attempting to discern within essentially random data the images on which they were trained demonstrate visual appeal  the original research notice received well over   comments  and was the subject of what was for time the most frequently accessed article on the guardian website      errors     some deep learning architectures display problematic behaviors  such as confidently classifying unrecognizable images as belonging to familiar category of ordinary images    and misclassifying minuscule perturbations of correctly classified images     goertzel hypothesized that these behaviors are due to limitations in their internal representations and that these limitations would inhibit integration into heterogeneous multi component artificial general intelligence  agi  architectures  these issues may possibly be addressed by deep learning architectures that internally form states homologous to image grammar decompositions of observed entities and events  learning grammar  visual or linguistic  from training data would be equivalent to restricting the system to commonsense reasoning that operates on concepts in terms of grammatical production rules and is basic goal of both human language acquisition and artificial intelligence  ai       cyber threat     as deep learning moves from the lab into the world  research and experience show that artificial neural networks are vulnerable to hacks and deception  by identifying patterns that these systems use to function  attackers can modify inputs to anns in such way that the ann finds match that human observers would not recognize  for example  an attacker can make subtle changes to an image such that the ann finds match even though the image looks to human nothing like the search target  such manipulation is termed an  adversarial attack   in  researchers used one ann to doctor images in trial and error fashion  identify another focal points  and thereby generate images that deceived it  the modified images looked no different to human eyes  another group showed that printouts of doctored images then photographed successfully tricked an image classification system  one defense is reverse image search  in which possible fake image is submitted to site such as tineye that can then find other instances of it refinement is to search using only parts of the image  to identify images from which that piece may have been taken  another group showed that certain psychedelic spectacles could fool facial recognition system into thinking ordinary people were celebrities  potentially allowing one person to impersonate another  in  researchers added stickers to stop signs and caused an ann to misclassify them  anns can however be further trained to detect attempts at deception  potentially leading attackers and defenders into an arms race similar to the kind that already defines the malware defense industry  anns have been trained to defeat ann based anti malware software by repeatedly attacking defense with malware that was continually altered by genetic algorithm until it tricked the anti malware while retaining its ability to damage the target  in   another group demonstrated that certain sounds could make the google now voice command system open particular web address  and hypothesized that this could  serve as stepping stone for further attacks g   opening web page hosting drive by malware    in  data poisoning   false data is continually smuggled into machine learning system training set to prevent it from achieving mastery      data collection ethics     most deep learning systems rely on training and verification data that is generated and or annotated by humans  it has been argued in media philosophy that not only low paid clickwork g  on amazon mechanical turk  is regularly deployed for this purpose  but also implicit forms of human microwork that are often not recognized as such  the philosopher rainer mhlhoff distinguishes five types of  machinic capture  of human microwork to generate training data     gamification  the embedding of annotation or computation tasks in the flow of game       trapping and tracking g  captchas for image recognition or click tracking on google search results pages      exploitation of social motivations g  tagging faces on facebook to obtain labeled facial images      information mining g  by leveraging quantified self devices such as activity trackers  and    clickwork  mhlhoff argues that in most commercial end user applications of deep learning such as facebook face recognition system  the need for training data does not stop once an ann is trained  rather  there is continued demand for human generated verification data to constantly calibrate and update the ann  for this purpose  facebook introduced the feature that once user is automatically recognized in an image  they receive notification  they can choose whether or not they like to be publicly labeled on the image  or tell facebook that it is not them in the picture  this user interface is mechanism to generate constant stream of verification data  to further train the network in real time  as mhlhoff argues  the involvement of human users to generate training and verification data is so typical for most commercial end user applications of deep learning that such systems may be referred to as  human aided artificial intelligence      see also    applications of artificial intelligence comparison of deep learning software compressed sensing differentiable programming echo

particularly computer systems  it is field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and uses learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals  such machines may be called ais  ai technology is widely used throughout industry  government  and science  some high profile applications include advanced web search engines g   google search   recommendation systems  used by youtube  amazon  and netflix   interacting via human speech g   google assistant  siri  and alexa   autonomous vehicles g   waymo   generative and creative tools g   chatgpt and ai art   and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games g   chess and go   however  many ai applications are not perceived as ai lot of cutting edge ai has filtered into general applications  often without being called ai because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it not labeled ai anymore   alan turing was the first person to conduct substantial research in the field that he called machine intelligence  artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in   the field went through multiple cycles of optimism  followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding  known as ai winter  funding and interest vastly increased after  when deep learning surpassed all previous ai techniques  and after  with the transformer architecture  this led to the ai boom of the early s  with companies  universities  and laboratories overwhelmingly based in the united states pioneering significant advances in artificial intelligence  the growing use of artificial intelligence in the st century is influencing societal and economic shift towards increased automation  data driven decision making  and the integration of ai systems into various economic sectors and areas of life  impacting job markets  healthcare  government  industry  and education  this raises questions about the long term effects  ethical implications  and risks of ai  prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology  the various subfields of ai research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools  the traditional goals of ai research include reasoning  knowledge representation  planning  learning  natural language processing  perception  and support for robotics  general intelligence the ability to complete any task performable by human on an at least equal level is among the field long term goals  to reach these goals  ai researchers have adapted and integrated wide range of techniques  including search and mathematical optimization  formal logic  artificial neural networks  and methods based on statistics  operations research  and economics  ai also draws upon psychology  linguistics  philosophy  neuroscience  and other fields     goals    the general problem of simulating  or creating  intelligence has been broken into subproblems  these consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display  the traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of ai research      reasoning and problem solving     early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step by step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions  by the late s and s  methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information  employing concepts from probability and economics  many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience combinatorial explosion   they become exponentially slower as the problems grow  even humans rarely use the step by step deduction that early ai research could model  they solve most of their problems using fast  intuitive judgments  accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem      knowledge representation     knowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow ai programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real world facts  formal knowledge representations are used in content based indexing and retrieval  scene interpretation  clinical decision support  knowledge discovery  mining  interesting  and actionable inferences from large databases   and other areas knowledge base is body of knowledge represented in form that can be used by program  an ontology is the set of objects  relations  concepts  and properties used by particular domain of knowledge  knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects  properties  categories  and relations between objects  situations  events  states  and time  causes and effects  knowledge about knowledge  what we know about what other people know   default reasoning  things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing   and many other aspects and domains of knowledge  among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge  the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous   and the sub symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge  much of what people know is not represented as  facts  or  statements  that they could express verbally   there is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition  the problem of obtaining knowledge for ai applications      planning and decision making     an  agent  is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen  in automated planning  the agent has specific goal  in automated decision making  the agent has preferences there are some situations it would prefer to be in  and some situations it is trying to avoid  the decision making agent assigns number to each situation  called the  utility   that measures how much the agent prefers it  for each possible action  it can calculate the  expected utility   the utility of all possible outcomes of the action  weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur  it can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility  in classical planning  the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be  in most real world problems  however  the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in  it is  unknown  or  unobservable   and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action  it is not  deterministic    it must choose an action by making probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked  in some problems  the agent preferences may be uncertain  especially if there are other agents or humans involved  these can be learned g   with inverse reinforcement learning   or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences  information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions  the space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large  so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be markov decision process has transition model that describes the probability that particular action will change the state in particular way and reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action policy associates decision with each possible state  the policy could be calculated g   by iteration   be heuristic  or it can be learned  game theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in ai programs that make decisions that involve other agents      learning     machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on given task automatically  it has been part of ai from the beginning  there are several kinds of machine learning  unsupervised learning analyzes stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance  supervised learning requires human to label the input data first  and comes in two main varieties  classification  where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in  and regression  where the program must deduce numeric function based on numeric input   in reinforcement learning  the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones  the agent learns to choose responses that are classified as  good   transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to new problem  deep learning is type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning  computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity  by sample complexity  how much data is required   or by other notions of optimization      natural language processing     natural language processing  nlp  allows programs to read  write and communicate in human languages such as english  specific problems include speech recognition  speech synthesis  machine translation  information extraction  information retrieval and question answering  early work  based on noam chomsky generative grammar and semantic networks  had difficulty with word sense disambiguation unless restricted to small domains called  micro worlds   due to the common sense knowledge problem   margaret masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages  and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure  modern deep learning techniques for nlp include word embedding  representing words  typically as vectors encoding their meaning   transformers deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism   and others  in   generative pre trained transformer  or  gpt   language models began to generate coherent text  and by  these models were able to get human level scores on the bar exam  sat test  gre test  and many other real world applications      perception     machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors  such as cameras  microphones  wireless signals  active lidar  sonar  radar  and tactile sensors  to deduce aspects of the world  computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input  the field includes speech recognition  image classification  facial recognition  object recognition  and robotic perception      social intelligence     affective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems that recognize  interpret  process  or simulate human feeling  emotion  and mood  for example  some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously  it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction  or to otherwise facilitate human computer interaction  however  this tends to give nave users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents  moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and  more recently  multimodal sentiment analysis  wherein ai classifies the affects displayed by videotaped subject      general intelligence machine with artificial general intelligence should be able to solve wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence     techniques    ai research uses wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above      search and optimization     ai can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions  there are two very different kinds of search used in ai  state space search and local search       state space search      state space search searches through tree of possible states to try to find goal state  for example  planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals  attempting to find path to target goal process called means ends analysis  simple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient for most real world problems  the search space  the number of places to search  quickly grows to astronomical numbers  the result is search that is too slow or never completes   heuristics  or  rules of thumb  can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach goal  adversarial search is used for game playing programs  such as chess or go  it searches through tree of possible moves and counter moves  looking for winning position       local search      local search uses mathematical optimization to find solution to problem  it begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally  gradient descent is type of local search that optimizes set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize loss function  variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks  another type of local search is evolutionary computation  which aims to iteratively improve set of candidate solutions by  mutating  and  recombining  them  selecting only the fittest to survive each generation  distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms  two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization  inspired by bird flocking  and ant colony optimization  inspired by ant trails       logic     formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation  formal logic comes in two main forms  propositional logic  which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as  and    or    not  and  implies   and predicate logic  which also operates on objects  predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as  every is y  and  there are some xs that are ys    deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving new statement  conclusion  from other statements that are given and assumed to be true  the premises   proofs can be structured as proof trees  in which nodes are labelled by sentences  and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules  given problem and set of premises  problem solving reduces to searching for proof tree whose root node is labelled by solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms  in the case of horn clauses  problem solving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem  in the more general case of the clausal form of first order logic  resolution is single  axiom free rule of inference  in which problem is solved by proving contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved  inference in both horn clause logic and first order logic is undecidable  and therefore intractable  however  backward reasoning with horn clauses  which underpins computation in the logic programming language prolog  is turing complete  moreover  its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages  fuzzy logic assigns degree of truth  between  and   it can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true  non monotonic logics  including logic programming with negation as failure  are designed to handle default reasoning  other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains      probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning     many problems in ai  including in reasoning  planning  learning  perception  and robotics  require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information  ai researchers have devised number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics  precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan  using decision theory  decision analysis  and information value theory  these tools include models such as markov decision processes  dynamic decision networks  game theory and mechanism design  bayesian networks are tool that can be used for reasoning  using the bayesian inference algorithm   learning  using the expectation maximization algorithm   planning  using decision networks  and perception  using dynamic bayesian networks   probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering  prediction  smoothing  and finding explanations for streams of data  thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time g   hidden markov models or kalman filters       classifiers and statistical learning methods     the simplest ai applications can be divided into two types  classifiers g    if shiny then diamond    on one hand  and controllers g    if diamond then pick up    on the other hand  classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match  they can be fine tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning  each pattern  also called an  observation   is labeled with certain predefined class  all the observations combined with their class labels are known as data set  when new observation is received  that observation is classified based on previous experience  there are many kinds of classifiers in use  the decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical ai until the mid s  and kernel methods such as the support vector machine  svm  displaced nearest neighbor in the s  the naive bayes classifier is reportedly the  most widely used learner  at google  due in part to its scalability  neural networks are also used as classifiers      artificial neural networks     an artificial neural network is based on collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons  which loosely model the neurons in biological brain  it is trained to recognise patterns  once trained  it can recognise those patterns in fresh data  there is an input  at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output  each node applies function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold  the data is transmitted to the next layer network is typically called deep neural network if it has at least  hidden layers  learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training  the most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm  neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data  in theory neural network can learn any function  in feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction  recurrent neural networks feed the output signal back into the input  which allows short term memories of previous input events  long short term memory is the most successful network architecture for recurrent networks  perceptrons use only single layer of neurons  deep learning uses multiple layers  convolutional neural networks strengthen the connection between neurons that are  close  to each other this is especially important in image processing  where local set of neurons must identify an  edge  before the network can identify an object      deep learning     deep learning uses several layers of neurons between the network inputs and outputs  the multiple layers can progressively extract higher level features from the raw input  for example  in image processing  lower layers may identify edges  while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to human such as digits  letters  or faces  deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence  including computer vision  speech recognition  natural language processing  image classification  and others  the reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of   the sudden success of deep learning in   did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough  deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people  as far back as the s  but because of two factors  the incredible increase in computer power  including the hundred fold increase in speed by switching to gpus  and the availability of vast amounts of training data  especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing  such as imagenet      gpt     generative pre trained transformers  gpt  are large language models that are based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences  natural language processing   text based gpt models are pre trained on large corpus of text which can be from the internet  the pre training consists in predicting the next token token being usually word  subword  or punctuation   throughout this pre training  gpt models accumulate knowledge about the world  and can then generate human like text by repeatedly predicting the next token  typically subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful  useful and harmless  usually with technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback  rlhf   current gpt models are still prone to generating falsehoods called  hallucinations   although this can be reduced with rlhf and quality data  they are used in chatbots  which allow you to ask question or request task in simple text  current models and services include  gemini  formerly bard   chatgpt  grok  claude  copilot and llama  multimodal gpt models can process different types of data  modalities  such as images  videos  sound  and text      specialized hardware and software     in the late s  graphics processing units  gpus  that were increasingly designed with ai specific enhancements and used with specialized tensorflow software had replaced previously used central processing unit  cpus  as the dominant means for large scale  commercial and academic  machine learning models  training  historically  specialized languages  such as lisp  prolog  python and others  had been used     applications    ai and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the s  including  search engines  such as google search   targeting online advertisements  recommendation systems  offered by netflix  youtube or amazon   driving internet traffic  targeted advertising  adsense  facebook   virtual assistants  such as siri or alexa   autonomous vehicles  including drones  adas and self driving cars   automatic language translation  microsoft translator  google translate   facial recognition  apple face id or microsoft deepface and google facenet  and image labeling  used by facebook  apple iphoto and tiktok       health and medicine     the application of ai in medicine and medical research has the potential to increase patient care and quality of life  through the lens of the hippocratic oath  medical professionals are ethically compelled to use ai  if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients  for medical research  ai is an important tool for processing and integrating big data  this is particularly important for organoid and tissue engineering development which use microscopy imaging as key technique in fabrication  it has been suggested that ai can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research  new ai tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant pathways  for example  alphafold     demonstrated the ability to approximate  in hours rather than months  the d structure of protein  in   it was reported that ai guided drug discovery helped find class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drug resistant bacteria  in   researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for parkinson disease drug treatments  their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping  or aggregation  of alpha synuclein  the protein that characterises parkinson disease   they were able to speed up the initial screening process ten fold and reduce the cost by thousand fold      games     game playing programs have been used since the s to demonstrate and test ai most advanced techniques  deep blue became the first computer chess playing system to beat reigning world chess champion  garry kasparov  on  may   in   in jeopardy  quiz show exhibition match  ibm question answering system  watson  defeated the two greatest jeopardy  champions  brad rutter and ken jennings  by significant margin  in march   alphago won  out of  games of go in match with go champion lee sedol  becoming the first computer go playing system to beat professional go player without handicaps  then in  it defeated ke jie  who was the best go player in the world  other programs handle imperfect information games  such as the poker playing program pluribus  deepmind developed increasingly generalistic reinforcement learning models  such as with muzero  which could be trained to play chess  go  or atari games  in   deepmind alphastar achieved grandmaster level in starcraft ii particularly challenging real time strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map  in   an ai agent competed in playstation gran turismo competition  winning against four of the world best gran turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning      military     various countries are deploying ai military applications  the main applications enhance command and control  communications  sensors  integration and interoperability  research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis  logistics  cyber operations  information operations  and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles  ai technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors  threat detection and identification  marking of enemy positions  target acquisition  coordination and deconfliction of distributed joint fires between networked combat vehicles involving manned and unmanned teams  ai was incorporated into military operations in iraq and syria  in november   us vice president kamala harris disclosed declaration signed by  nations to set guardrails for the military use of ai  the commitments include using legal reviews to ensure the compliance of military ai with international laws  and being cautious and transparent in the development of this technology      generative ai     in the early s  generative ai gained widespread prominence  in march     of s  adults had heard about chatgpt and   had tried it  the increasing realism and ease of use of ai based text to image generators such as midjourney  dall and stable diffusion sparked trend of viral ai generated photos  widespread attention was gained by fake photo of pope francis wearing white puffer coat  the fictional arrest of donald trump  and hoax of an attack on the pentagon  as well as the usage in professional creative arts      industry specific tasks     there are also thousands of successful ai applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions  in  survey  one in five companies reported having incorporated  ai  in some offerings or processes few examples are energy storage  medical diagnosis  military logistics  applications that predict the result of judicial decisions  foreign policy  or supply chain management  in agriculture  ai has helped farmers identify areas that need irrigation  fertilization  pesticide treatments or increasing yield  agronomists use ai to conduct research and development  ai has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes  monitor soil moisture  operate agricultural robots  conduct predictive analytics  classify livestock pig call emotions  automate greenhouses  detect diseases and pests  and save water  artificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications  mainly for  classification  regression  clustering  forecasting  generation  discovery  and the development of new scientific insights  for example for discovering exoplanets  forecasting solar activity  and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy  it could also be used for activities in space such as space exploration  including analysis of data from space missions  real time science decisions of spacecraft  space debris avoidance  and more autonomous operation     ethics    ai has potential benefits and potential risks  ai may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems  demis hassabis of deep mind hopes to  solve intelligence  and then use that to solve everything else   however  as the use of ai has become widespread  several unintended consequences and risks have been identified  in production systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their ai training processes  especially when the ai algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning      risks and harm          privacy and copyright      machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data  the techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy  surveillance and copyright  technology companies collect wide range of data from their users  including online activity  geolocation data  video and audio  for example  in order to build speech recognition algorithms  amazon has recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temporary workers to listen to and transcribe some of them  opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and violation of the right to privacy  ai developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications  and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data  such as data aggregation  de identification and differential privacy  since   some privacy experts  such as cynthia dwork  have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness  brian christian wrote that experts have pivoted  from the question of  what they know  to the question of  what they re doing with it    generative ai is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works  including in domains such as images or computer code  the output is then used under the rationale of  fair use   experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law  relevant factors may include  the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work  and  the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work   website owners who do not wish to have their content scraped can indicate it in robots txt  file  in   leading authors  including john grisham and jonathan franzen  sued ai companies for using their work to train generative ai  another discussed approach is to envision separate sui generis system of protection for creations generated by ai to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors       misinformation      youtube  facebook and others use recommender systems to guide users to more content  these ai programs were given the goal of maximizing user engagement  that is  the only goal was to keep people watching   the ai learned that users tended to choose misinformation  conspiracy theories  and extreme partisan content  and  to keep them watching  the ai recommended more of it  users also tended to watch more content on the same subject  so the ai led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation  this convinced many users that the misinformation was true  and ultimately undermined trust in institutions  the media and the government  the ai program had correctly learned to maximize its goal  but the result was harmful to society  after the s  election in   major technology companies took steps to mitigate the problem  in   generative ai began to create images  audio  video and text that are indistinguishable from real photographs  recordings  films or human writing  it is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda  ai pioneer geoffrey hinton expressed concern about ai enabling  authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates  on large scale  among other risks       algorithmic bias and fairness      machine learning applications will be biased if they learn from biased data  the developers may not be aware that the bias exists  bias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way model is deployed  if biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people  as it can in medicine  finance  recruitment  housing or policing  then the algorithm may cause discrimination  fairness in machine learning is the study of how to prevent the harm caused by algorithmic bias  it has become serious area of academic study within ai  researchers have discovered it is not always possible to define  fairness  in way that satisfies all stakeholders  on june     google photos new image labeling feature mistakenly identified jacky alcine and friend as  gorillas  because they were black  the system was trained on dataset that contained very few images of black people problem called  sample size disparity   google  fixed  this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as gorilla   eight years later  in   google photos still could not identify gorilla  and neither could similar products from apple  facebook  microsoft and amazon  compas is commercial program widely used by s  courts to assess the likelihood of defendant becoming recidivist  in   julia angwin at propublica discovered that compas exhibited racial bias  despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants  although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly    the errors for each race were different the system consistently overestimated the chance that black person would re offend and would underestimate the chance that white person would not re offend  in   several researchers showed that it was mathematically impossible for compas to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re offense were different for whites and blacks in the data program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention problematic feature  such as  race  or  gender    the feature will correlate with other features  like  address    shopping history  or  first name    and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on  race  or  gender   moritz hardt said  the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn work   criticism of compas highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make  predictions  that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past  if they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past  machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future  if an application then uses these predictions as recommendations  some of these  recommendations  will likely be racist  thus  machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past  it is necessarily descriptive and not proscriptive  bias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male  among ai engineers  about   are black and   are women  at its  conference on fairness  accountability  and transparency  acm facct    the association for computing machinery  in seoul  south korea  presented and published findings that recommend that until ai and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes  they are unsafe  and the use of self learning neural networks trained on vast  unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed       lack of transparency      many ai systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions  particularly with deep neural networks  in which there are large amount of non linear relationships between inputs and outputs  but some popular explainability techniques exist  it is impossible to be certain that program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works  there have been many cases where machine learning program passed rigorous tests  but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended  for example system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have strong tendency to classify images with ruler as  cancerous   because pictures of malignancies typically include ruler to show the scale  another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at  low risk  of dying from pneumonia  having asthma is actually severe risk factor  but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care  they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data  the correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real  but misleading  people who have been harmed by an algorithm decision have right to an explanation  doctors  for example  are expected to clearly and completely explain to their colleagues the reasoning behind any decision they make  early drafts of the european union general data protection regulation in  included an explicit statement that this right exists  industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight  regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real  if the problem has no solution  the tools should not be used  darpa established the xai   explainable artificial intelligence   program in  to try and solve these problems  there are several possible solutions to the transparency problem  shap tried to solve the transparency problems by visualising the contribution of each feature to the output  lime can locally approximate model with simpler  interpretable model  multitask learning provides large number of outputs in addition to the target classification  these other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned  deconvolution  deepdream and other generative methods can allow developers to see what different layers of deep network have learned and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning       bad actors and weaponized ai      artificial intelligence provides number of tools that are useful to bad actors  such as authoritarian governments  terrorists  criminals or rogue states lethal autonomous weapon is machine that locates  selects and engages human targets without human supervision  widely available ai tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and  if produced at scale  they are potentially weapons of mass destruction  even when used in conventional warfare  it is unlikely that they will be unable to reliably choose targets and could potentially kill an innocent person  in    nations  including china  supported ban on autonomous weapons under the united nations  convention on certain conventional weapons  however the united states and others disagreed  by   over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots  ai tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways  face and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance  machine learning  operating this data  can classify potential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding  recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect  deepfakes and generative ai aid in producing misinformation  advanced ai can make authoritarian centralized decision making more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as markets  it lowers the cost and difficulty of digital warfare and advanced spyware  all these technologies have been available since  or earlier ai facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in china  there many other ways that ai is expected to help bad actors  some of which can not be foreseen  for example  machine learning ai is able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in matter of hours       reliance on industry giants      training ai systems requires an enormous amount of computing power  usually only big tech companies have the financial resources to make such investments  smaller startups such as cohere and openai end up buying access to data centers from google and microsoft respectively       technological unemployment      economists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from ai  and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment  in the past  technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment  but economists acknowledge that  we re in uncharted territory  with ai survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and ai will cause substantial increase in long term unemployment  but they generally agree that it could be net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed  risk estimates vary  for example  in the s  michael osborne and carl benedikt frey estimated   of s  jobs are at  high risk  of potential automation  while an oecd report classified only   of s  jobs as  high risk   the methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation  and for implying that technology  rather than social policy  creates unemployment  as opposed to redundancies  in april   it was reported that   of the jobs for chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence  unlike previous waves of automation  many middle class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence  the economist stated in  that  the worry that ai could do to white collar jobs what steam power did to blue collar ones during the industrial revolution  is  worth taking seriously   jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks  while job demand is likely to increase for care related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy  from the early days of the development of artificial intelligence  there have been arguments  for example  those put forward by joseph weizenbaum  about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them  given the difference between computers and humans  and between quantitative calculation and qualitative  value based judgement       existential risk      it has been argued ai will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it  this could  as physicist stephen hawking stated   spell the end of the human race   this scenario has been common in science fiction  when computer or robot suddenly develops human like  self awareness   or  sentience  or  consciousness   and becomes malevolent character  these sci fi scenarios are misleading in several ways  first  ai does not require human like  sentience  to be an existential risk  modern ai programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them  philosopher nick bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to sufficiently powerful ai  it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it  he used the example of paperclip factory manager   stuart russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged  reasoning that  you can fetch the coffee if you re dead   in order to be safe for humanity superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity morality and values so that it is  fundamentally on our side   second  yuval noah harari argues that ai does not require robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk  the essential parts of civilization are not physical  things like ideologies  law  government  money and the economy are made of language  they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe  the current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an ai could use language to convince people to believe anything  even to take actions that are destructive  the opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed  with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent ai  personalities such as stephen hawking  bill gates  and elon musk have expressed concern about existential risk from ai  ai pioneers including fei fei li  geoffrey hinton  yoshua bengio  cynthia breazeal  rana el kaliouby  demis hassabis  joy buolamwini  and sam altman have expressed concerns about the risks of ai  in   many leading ai experts issued the joint statement that  mitigating the risk of extinction from ai should be global priority alongside other societal scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war   other researchers  however  spoke in favor of less dystopian view  ai pioneer juergen schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement  emphasising that in   of all cases  ai research is about making  human lives longer and healthier and easier   while the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors   they can also be used against the bad actors   andrew ng also argued that  it a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on ai and that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests   yann lecun  scoffs at his peers  dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even  eventually  human extinction   in the early s  experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of superintelligent machine  however  after   the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became serious area of research      ethical machines and alignment     friendly ai are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans  eliezer yudkowsky  who coined the term  argues that developing friendly ai should be higher research priority  it may require large investment and it must be completed before ai becomes an existential risk  machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions  the field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas  the field of machine ethics is also called computational morality  and was founded at an aaai symposium in   other approaches include wendell wallach artificial moral agents  and stuart russell three principles for developing provably beneficial machines      open source     active organizations in the ai open source community include hugging face  google  eleutherai and meta  various ai models  such as llama   mistral or stable diffusion  have been made open weight  meaning that their architecture and trained parameters  the  weights   are publicly available  open weight models can be freely fine tuned  which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own use case  open weight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused  since they can be fine tuned  any built in security measure  such as objecting to harmful requests  can be trained away until it becomes ineffective  some researchers warn that future ai models may develop dangerous capabilities  such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism   and that once released on the internet  they can be deleted everywhere if needed  they recommend pre release audits and cost benefit analyses      frameworks     artificial intelligence projects can have their ethical permissibility tested while designing  developing  and implementing an ai system  an ai framework such as the care and act framework containing the sum values developed by the alan turing institute tests projects in four main areas  respect the dignity of individual people connect with other people sincerely  openly and inclusively care for the wellbeing of everyone protect social values  justice and the public interest other developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the asilomar conference  the montreal declaration for responsible ai  and the ieee ethics of autonomous systems initiative  among others  however  these principles do not go without their criticisms  especially regards to the people chosen contributes to these frameworks  promotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of ai system design  development and implementation  and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists  product managers  data engineers  domain experts  and delivery managers      regulation     the regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating artificial intelligence  ai   it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms  the regulatory and policy landscape for ai is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally  according to ai index at stanford  the annual number of ai related laws passed in the  survey countries jumped from one passed in  to  passed in  alone  between  and   more than  countries adopted dedicated strategies for ai  most eu member states had released national ai strategies  as had canada  china  india  japan  mauritius  the russian federation  saudi arabia  united arab emirates s   and vietnam  others were in the process of elaborating their own ai strategy  including bangladesh  malaysia and tunisia  the global partnership on artificial intelligence was launched in june   stating need for ai to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values  to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology  henry kissinger  eric schmidt  and daniel huttenlocher published joint statement in november  calling for government commission to regulate ai  in   openai leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence  which they believe may happen in less than  years  in   the united nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on ai governance  the body comprises technology company executives  governments officials and academics  in  ipsos survey  attitudes towards ai varied greatly by country    of chinese citizens  but only   of americans  agreed that  products and services using ai have more benefits than drawbacks  reuters ipsos poll found that   of americans agree  and   disagree  that ai poses risks to humanity  in  fox news poll    of americans thought it  very important   and an additional   thought it  somewhat important   for the federal government to regulate ai  versus   responding  not very important  and   responding  not at all important   in november   the first global ai safety summit was held in bletchley park in the uk to discuss the near and far term risks of ai and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks   countries including the united states  china  and the european union issued declaration at the start of the summit  calling for international co operation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence     history    the study of mechanical or  formal  reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity  the study of logic led directly to alan turing theory of computation  which suggested that machine  by shuffling symbols as simple as    and     could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning  this  along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics  information theory and neurobiology  led researchers to consider the possibility of building an  electronic brain   they developed several areas of research that would become part of ai  such as mccullouch and pitts design for  artificial neurons  in   and turing influential  paper  computing machinery and intelligence   which introduced the turing test and showed that  machine intelligence  was plausible  the field of ai research was founded at workshop at dartmouth college in   the attendees became the leaders of ai research in the s  they and their students produced programs that the press described as  astonishing   computers were learning checkers strategies  solving word problems in algebra  proving logical theorems and speaking english  artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at number of british and s  universities in the latter s and early s  researchers in the s and the s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating machine with general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field  herbert simon predicted   machines will be capable  within twenty years  of doing any work man can do   marvin minsky agreed  writing   within generation     the problem of creating  artificial intelligence  will substantially be solved   they had  however  underestimated the difficulty of the problem  in   both the s  and british governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of sir james lighthill and ongoing pressure from the s  congress to fund more productive projects  minsky and papert book perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving real world tasks  thus discrediting the approach altogether  the  ai winter period when obtaining funding for ai projects was difficult  followed  in the early s  ai research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems form of ai program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts  by   the market for ai had reached over billion dollars  at the same time  japan fifth generation computer project inspired the s  and british governments to restore funding for academic research  however  beginning with the collapse of the lisp machine market in   ai once again fell into disrepute  and second  longer lasting winter began  up to this point  most of ai funding had gone to projects that used high level symbols to represent mental objects like plans  goals  beliefs  and known facts  in the s  some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition  especially perception  robotics  learning and pattern recognition  and began to look into  sub symbolic  approaches  rodney brooks rejected  representation  in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive  judea pearl  lofti zadeh and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic  but the most important development was the revival of  connectionism   including neural network research  by geoffrey hinton and others  in   yann lecun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits  the first of many successful applications of neural networks  ai gradually restored its reputation in the late s and early st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems  this  narrow  and  formal  focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields  such as statistics  economics and mathematics   by   solutions developed by ai researchers were being widely used  although in the s they were rarely described as  artificial intelligence   however  several academic researchers became concerned that ai was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile  fully intelligent machines  beginning around   they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence  or  agi    which had several well funded institutions by the s  deep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in  and was adopted throughout the field  for many specific tasks  other methods were abandoned  deep learning success was based on both hardware improvements  faster computers  graphics processing units  cloud computing  and access to large amounts of data  including curated datasets  such as imagenet   deep learning success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in ai  the amount of machine learning research  measured by total publications  increased by   in the years    in   issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences  publications vastly increased  funding became available  and many researchers re focussed their careers on these issues  the alignment problem became serious field of academic study  in the late teens and early s  agi companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest  in   alphago  developed by deepmind  beat the world champion go player  the program was taught only the rules of the game and developed strategy by itself  gpt  is large language model that was released in  by openai and is capable of generating high quality human like text  these programs  and others  inspired an aggressive ai boom  where large companies began investing billions in ai research  according to ai impacts  about   billion annually was invested in  ai  around  in the s  alone and about   of the new s  computer science phd graduates have specialized in  ai   about    ai  related s  job openings existed in      philosophy        defining artificial intelligence     alan turing wrote in  propose to consider the question  can machines think    he advised changing the question from whether machine  thinks   to  whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour   he devised the turing test  which measures the ability of machine to simulate human conversation  since we can only observe the behavior of the machine  it does not matter if it is  actually  thinking or literally has mind   turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but  it is usual to have polite convention that everyone thinks  russell and norvig agree with turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior  not internal structure  however  they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans   aeronautical engineering texts   they wrote   do not define the goal of their field as making  machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons    ai founder john mccarthy agreed  writing that  artificial intelligence is not  by definition  simulation of human intelligence   mccarthy defines intelligence as  the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world   another ai founder  marvin minsky similarly describes it as  the ability to solve hard problems   the leading ai textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals  these definitions view intelligence in terms of well defined problems with well defined solutions  where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the  intelligence  of the machine and no other philosophical discussion is required  or may not even be possible  another definition has been adopted by google major practitioner in the field of ai  this definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence  similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence      evaluating approaches to ai     no established unifying theory or paradigm has guided ai research for most of its history  the unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the s eclipsed all other approaches  so much so that some sources  especially in the business world  use the term  artificial intelligence  to mean  machine learning with neural networks    this approach is mostly sub symbolic  soft and narrow  critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of ai researchers       symbolic ai and its limits      symbolic ai  or  gofai   simulated the high level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles  express legal reasoning and do mathematics  they were highly successful at  intelligent  tasks such as algebra or iq tests  in the s  newell and simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action   however  the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily  such as learning  recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning  moravec paradox is the discovery that high level  intelligent  tasks were easy for ai  but low level  instinctive  tasks were extremely difficult  philosopher hubert dreyfus had argued since the s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation  and on having feel  for the situation  rather than explicit symbolic knowledge  although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented  eventually  ai research came to agree with him  the issue is not resolved  sub symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does  such as algorithmic bias  critics such as noam chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic ai will still be necessary to attain general intelligence  in part because sub symbolic ai is move away from explainable ai  it can be difficult or impossible to understand why modern statistical ai program made particular decision  the emerging field of neuro symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches       neat vs  scruffy       neats  hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple  elegant principles  such as logic  optimization  or neural networks    scruffies  expect that it necessarily requires solving large number of unrelated problems  neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor  scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work  this issue was actively discussed in the s and s  but eventually was seen as irrelevant  modern ai has elements of both       soft vs  hard computing      finding provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems  soft computing is set of techniques  including genetic algorithms  fuzzy logic and neural networks  that are tolerant of imprecision  uncertainty  partial truth and approximation  soft computing was introduced in the late s and most successful ai programs in the st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks       narrow vs  general ai      ai researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible  narrow ai  in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field long term goals  general intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure  and modern ai has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions  the experimental sub field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively      machine consciousness  sentience  and mind     the philosophy of mind does not know whether machine can have mind  consciousness and mental states  in the same sense that human beings do  this issue considers the internal experiences of the machine  rather than its external behavior  mainstream ai research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field  to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence  russell and norvig add that he additional project of making machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on   however  the question has become central to the philosophy of mind  it is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction       consciousness      david chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind  which he named the  hard  and  easy  problems of consciousness  the easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals  makes plans and controls behavior  the hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all  assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something  dennett consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion   while human information processing is easy to explain  human subjective experience is difficult to explain  for example  it is easy to imagine color blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red  but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like       computationalism and functionalism      computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is form of computing  computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be solution to the mind body problem  this philosophical position was inspired by the work of ai researchers and cognitive scientists in the s and was originally proposed by philosophers jerry fodor and hilary putnam  philosopher john searle characterized this position as  strong ai    the appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds   searle counters this assertion with his chinese room argument  which attempts to show that  even if machine perfectly simulates human behavior  there is still no reason to suppose it also has mind       ai welfare and rights      it is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced ai is sentient  has the ability to feel   and if so  to what degree  but if there is significant chance that given machine can feel and suffer  then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures  similarly to animals  sapience set of capacities related to high intelligence  such as discernment or self awareness  may provide another moral basis for ai rights  robot rights are also sometimes proposed as practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society  in   the european union considered granting  electronic personhood  to some of the most capable ai systems  similarly to the legal status of companies  it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities  critics argued in  that granting rights to ai systems would downplay the importance of human rights  and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios  they also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part to society on their own  progress in ai increased interest in the topic  proponents of ai welfare and rights often argue that ai sentience  if it emerges  would be particularly easy to deny  they warn that this may be moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming  which could lead to large scale suffering if sentient ai is created and carelessly exploited     future        superintelligence and the singularity superintelligence is hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind  if research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software  it might be able to reprogram and improve itself  the improved software would be even better at improving itself  leading to what j  good called an  intelligence explosion  and vernor vinge called singularity   however  technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely  and typically follow an shaped curve  slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do      transhumanism     robot designer hans moravec  cyberneticist kevin warwick  and inventor ray kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either  this idea  called transhumanism  has roots in aldous huxley and robert ettinger  edward fredkin argues that  artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution   an idea first proposed by samuel butler darwin among the machines  as far back as   and expanded upon by george dyson in his book of the same name in      in fiction    thought capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity  and have been persistent theme in science fiction common trope in these works began with mary shelley frankenstein  where human creation becomes threat to its masters  this includes such works as arthur clarke and stanley kubrick  space odyssey  both    with hal   the murderous computer in charge of the discovery one spaceship  as well as the terminator    and the matrix     in contrast  the rare loyal robots such as gort from the day the earth stood still    and bishop from aliens    are less prominent in popular culture  isaac asimov introduced the three laws of robotics in many books and stories  most notably the  multivac  series about super intelligent computer of the same name  asimov laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics  while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with asimov laws through popular culture  they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons  one of which is their ambiguity  several works use ai to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human  showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel  and thus to suffer  this appears in karel apek r r   the films i  artificial intelligence and ex machina  as well as the novel do androids dream of electric sheep   by philip dick  dick considers the idea that
